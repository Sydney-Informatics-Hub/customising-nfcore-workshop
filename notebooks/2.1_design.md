### Objectives{.unlisted}

- Use the nf-core documentation to select appropriate parameters for a run command 
- Write and run a nf-core rnaseq command on the command line 
- Explore workflow deployment and set up 

</div>

### **Reproducibility is a state of mind**{.unlisted}

It can be very easy to lose track while working on the command line, especially when we're working with large datasets and complex commands as we do with bioinformatics workflows. To make sure we work reproducibly, we will be organising our workspace and using a local copy of the [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq) workflow for all exercises. 

Start by creating a new directory for all of today's activities and move into it: 

```bash
mkdir ~/nfcore-workshop/session2 && cd $_
```

There are a number of ways to download a nf-core workflow to your machine. We recommend using git or nf-core tools. 

To download the workflow using the nf-core tools utility, read and follow directions [here](https://nf-co.re/tools/) and complete the following exercise: 


<div class="challenge">

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

What command would you run to find and download a local copy of the nf-core/rnaseq v3.10.1 workflow without downloading any containers using the nf-core tools utility? 

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Search for the rnaseq pipeline: 
```bash
nf-core list rnaseq
```

Then, download the correct pipeline: 
```bash
nf-core download nf-core/rnaseq
```

You will be prompted to select a version. Use your arrow keys to specify 3.10.1 and hit enter. 

```bash
ubuntu@georgiedev:~$ nf-core download nf-core/rnaseq

                                          ,--./,-.

    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'

Check the workflow has been downloaded:

Alternatively, to download the most recent version of the workflow from it's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq) with git, run: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq.git
```

### **Building your run command**{.unlisted}

All nf-core workflows are provided with sensible default settings that have broad applicability and comprensive documentation that explains all available parameters. What is 'sensible' varies dramatically between different experiments, computing environments, and datasets, so these settings might not suit your needs.
