In this session we will be writing, running, adjusting, and rerunning the nf-core/rnaseq workflow run command as we step through various customisation scenarios. While all activities in this session will be performed using the nf-core/rnaseq workflow, all customisation scenarios we explore are applicable to other nf-core workflows and do not require an understanding of rnaseq data processing. 

### **Things to keep in mind**{.unlisted}

Before starting this session, we will discuss some important considerations and recommendations for you to keep in mind as you proceed through the lessons and apply these techniques to your own research. Some things to keep in mind: 

* nf-core is a collaborative, open source, community-driven effort 
* nf-core prioritises workflows that are in high-demand and have broad applicability
* nf-core workflows are not all built to the same standard, some are works in progress
* Workflow developers volunteer their time to build, support, and maintain their workflows
* The level of support and ongoing maintenance available differ between workflows
* nf-core is a very young community, it only started in 2018! 

As with other open source bioinformatics resources, nf-core workflows may not suit all applications. It is important that you understand the needs of your dataset and research questions before deciding on a workflow. We recommend approaching the application and customisation of nf-core workflows with the following framework: 

* Endeavour to understand the structure and requirements of the workflow
* Use reproducible coding practices and follow nf-core guidelines 
* Document your customisations and the reasons for those changes 
* Test your changes thoroughly 
* Consider contributing to the community 
* Seek help from developers and the community
