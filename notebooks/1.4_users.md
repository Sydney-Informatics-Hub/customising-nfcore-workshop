### Objectives{.unlisted}

- Learn more about nf-core tooling for users.
- Use `nf-core list` to view information about nf-core workflows.
- Use `nf-core download` to download a workflow and it's singularity images.
- Use `nf-core launch` to create a parameters file.

### **1.4.1 nf-core tools for users**

nf-core tools has additional commands to help **users** execute workflows. Although you do not need to use these commands to execute the nf-core workflows, they can greatly assist and improve and simplify your experience.

There are also nf-core tools for **developers**. However, these will not be covered as a part of this workshop. If you are curious to learn more about these tools you can find more information on the nf-core websites [tools page](https://nf-co.re/tools/). There are also lots of excellent ByteSize talks on the [nf-core YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/nf-core).

### **1.4.2 `nf-core list`**

The nf-core `list` command can be used to print a list of remote nf-core workflows along with your local workflow information.

```default
nf-core list
```

![](../figs/1.4_nf-corelist.svg){width=100%}

The output shows the latest workflow version number and when it was released. You will also be shown if and when a workflow was pulled locally and whether you have the latest version.

Keywords can also be supplied to help filter the workflows based on matches in titles, descriptions, or topics:

```default
nf-core list dna
```

![](../figs/1.4_nf-corelist-dna.svg){width=100%}

Options can also be used to sort the workflows by latest release (`-s release`, default), when you last pulled a workflow locally (`-s pulled`), alphabetically (`-s name`), or number by the number of GitHub stars (`-s stars`).

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Filter the list of nf-core workflows for those that are for `rna` and sort them by stars. Which `rna` workflow has the most stars?

:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

Execute the `list` command, filter it for `rna`, and sort by `stars`:

```default
nf-core list rna -s stars
```

### **1.4.2 `nf-core launch`**

A workflow can have a large number of optional parameters. To help with this, the `nf-core launch` command is designed to help you write parameter files for when you launch your workflow.

The nf-core `launch` command takes one argument - either the name of an nf-core workflow which will be pulled automatically **or** the path to a directory containing a Nextflow workflow:

```default
nf-core launch nf-core/<workflow>
```

When running this command, you will first be asked about which version of the workflow you would like to execute. Next, you will be given the choice between a web-based graphical interface or an interactive command-line wizard tool to enter the workflow parameters. Both interfaces show documentation alongside each parameter, will generate a run ID, and will validate your inputs.

![](../figs/1.4_wizard.excalidraw.png){width=100%}

The nf-core `launch` tool uses the `nextflow_schema.json` file from a workflow to give parameter descriptions, defaults, and grouping. If no file for the workflow is found, one will be automatically generated at runtime.

The `launch` tool will save your parameter variables as a `.json` file called `nf-params.json`. It will also suggest an execution command that includes the `-params-file` flag and your new `nf-params.json` file. The command line wizard will finish by asking if you want to launch the workflow. Any profiles or options that were set using the wizard will be included in your `run` command.

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Generate a schema and run command for revision `3.11.1` of the `nf-core/rnaseq` workflow using the nf-core `launch` command. Use the `test` and `singularity` profiles and name your output folder `my_test_output`.

:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

Use the nf-core `launch` command for the `nf-core/rnaseq` workflow and follow the prompts:

Your `nf-params.json` file should look like this:

```default
{
    "outdir": "my_test_output"
}
```

Your final `run` command should look like this:

```default
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.11.1 -profile test,singularity -params-file nf-params.json
```

Launch the workflow from your command line with the run command. You will see the run command will download the required singularity images for you automatically.

:::

You can also use the launch command directly from the [nf-core launch website](https://nf-co.re/launch). In this case, you can configure your workflow using the wizard and then copy the outputs to your terminal or use the run id generated by the wizard. You will need to be connected to the internet to use the run id.

```default
nf-core launch --id <run_id>
```

### **1.4.3 `nf-core download`**

Sometimes you may need to execute an nf-core workflow on a server or HPC system that has no internet connection. In this case, you will need to fetch the workflow files and manually transfer them to your offline system. To make this process easier and ensure accurate retrieval of correctly versioned code and software containers, nf-core has the `download` command.

The nf-core `download` command will download both the workflow code and the institutional nf-core/configs files. It can also optionally download singularity image file.

```default
nf-core download
```

If run without any arguments, the download tool will interactively prompt you for the required information. Each prompt option has a flag and if all flags are supplied then it will run without a request for any additional user input:

- **Pipeline name**
  - Name of workflow you would like to download.
- **Pipeline revision**
  - The revision you would like to download.
- **Pull containers**
  - If you would like to download Singularity images.
  - The path to a folder where you would like to store these images if you have not set your `NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR`.
- **Choose compression type**
  - The compression type for Singularity images.

Alternatively, you could build your own execution command with the command line options.

::: callout-tip

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Use the nf-core `download` command to download revision `3.11.1` of the `nf-core/rnaseq` workflow **with** it's **uncompressed** Singularity images. You can use either the command line options or prompts.

:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

Use the nf-core `download` command for the `nf-core/rnaseq` workflow and follow the prompts.

If you were to write your own command and options it would look like this:

```default
nf-core download nf-core/rnaseq --revision 3.11.1 --container singularity --compress none
```

### **Key points**

- The nf-core `list` command can be used to view local and remote information about nf-core workflows.
- The nf-core `download` command is a powerful way to download a workflow and its Singularity images.
- The nf-core `launch` command can be a useful tool for writing parameter files.
