Commands for users



# nf-core list

The nf-core `list` command shows all available nf-core pipelines along with their latest version, when that was published and how recently the pipeline code was pulled to your local system.

An example of the output from the command is as follows:

<!-- RICH-CODEX head: 19 -->

![`nf-core list`](figs/1.4_nf-core-list.png)

To narrow down the list, supply one or more additional keywords to filter the pipelines based on matches in titles, descriptions and topics:

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Try to find out which workflows are available and if you have any locally:

:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

Run the `list` command to see what workflows are available.

```bash
nf-core list
```

:::

The output shows the latest workflow version number and when that was released. It also tells you if and when a workflow was been pulled locally and whether you have the latest version.

Unless you are actively developing workflow code, you can use Nextflowâ€™s built-in functionality to fetch nf-core workflows. You can use the Nextflow `pull` command to download the latest version of a remote workflow from the [nf-core GitHub repository](https://github.com/nf-core/):

```bash
nextflow pull nf-core/<workflow>
```

Nextflow can also fetch the workflow code when you run it without pulling the workflow beforehand:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/<workflow>
```

> Nextflow will fetch the default git branch if a workflow version is not specified. This will be the master branch for workflows with a stable release.

nf-core workflows use GitHub releases to tag stable versions of the code and software. You will always be able to run a previous version of a workflow once it is released.

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Try to pull the latest version of the `nf-core/rnaseq` workflow directly from GitHub using Nextflow and check what version you have locally.

:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

Use `nextflow pull` to download the `rnaseq` workflow from the `nf-core` GitHub repository.

```bash
nextflow pull nf-core/rnaseq
```

Use `nf-core list` to view what version of the workflow you have locally

```bash
nf-core list
```

# nf-core launch

Nextflow workflows can have a considerable number of optional command line flags. To help manage these, you can use the `nf-core launch` command.

The command takes one argument - either the name of an nf-core workflow which will be pulled automatically or the path to a directory containing a Nextflow workflow. For example:

```bash
nf-core launch nf-core/<workflow name>
```

When running this command, you will first be asked about which version of a workflow you would like to run. Next, you will be given the choice between a web-based graphical interface or an interactive command-line wizard tool to enter the workflow parameters for your run. Both interfaces show documentation alongside each parameter and validate your inputs.

The tool uses the `nextflow_schema.json` file from a workflow to give parameter descriptions, defaults, and grouping. If no file for the workflow is found, one will be automatically generated at runtime.

Nextflow parameter variables are saved into a JSON file called `nf-params.json` and used by Nextflow with the `-params-file` flag.

The wizard will ask if you want to launch the Nextflow run. You will also be given the run command and a copy of the JSON file for you to copy and paste if you wish.

# nf-core download

Sometimes you may need to run an nf-core workflow on a server or HPC system that has no internet connection. In this case, you will need to fetch the workflow files and manually transfer them to your system.

To make this process easier and ensure accurate retrieval of correctly versioned code and software containers, nf-core has a `download` helper tool.

The nf-core `download` command will download both the workflow code and the institutional nf-core/configs files. It can also optionally download singularity image file.

```bash
nf-core download
```

If run without any arguments, the download tool will interactively prompt you for the required information. Each prompt option has a flag and if all flags are supplied then it will run without a request for any additional user input.
