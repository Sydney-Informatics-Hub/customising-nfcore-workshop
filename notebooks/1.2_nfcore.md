# What is nf-core?

![](../figs/nf-core-logo.png){width=100%}

nf-core is a community effort to collect a curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow.

**For facilities**

Highly optimised pipelines with excellent reporting. Validated releases ensure reproducibility.

**For users**

Portable, documented and easy to use workflows. Pipelines that you can trust.

**For developers**

Companion templates and tools help to validate your code and simplify common tasks.

nf-core is published in Nature Biotechnology! [Nat Biotechnol 38, 276–278 (2020). Nature Biotechnology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0439-x)

## Key Features of nf-core pipelines

**Documentation**

nf-core pipelines have extensive documentation covering installation, usage, and description of output files to ensure that you won't be left in the dark.

**CI Testing**

Every time a change is made to the pipeline code, nf-core pipelines use continuous-integration testing to ensure that nothing has broken.

**Stable Releases**

nf-core pipelines use GitHub releases to tag stable versions of the code and software, making pipeline runs totally reproducible.

**Packaged software**

Pipeline dependencies are automatically downloaded and handled using Docker, Singularity, Conda, or other software management tools. There is no need for any software installations.

**Portable and reproducible**

nf-core pipelines follow best practices to ensure maximum portability and reproducibility. The large community makes the pipelines exceptionally well-tested and easy to run.

**Cloud-ready**

nf-core pipelines are tested on AWS after every major release. You can even browse results live on the website and use outputs for your own benchmarking.

## Events

The nf-core community is a vibrant global community with regular community-driven events:

- Seminars
- Hackathons
- Community training

Keep an eye on the [nf-core event page] for more information.

## nf-core tooling

This tutorial will make use of the nf-core/tools, a set of helper tools for use with nf-core Nextflow pipelines. The tool has been developed to provide a range of additional functionality such as pipeline creation, testing, and more.

The nf-core tool is written in Python and is available from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/nf-core/).

```bash
pip install nf-core
```

Alternatively, nf-core/tools can be installed from [Bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/nf-core):

```bash
conda install -c bioconda nf-core
```

::: callout-tip

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Find out what version of nf-core/tools you have available using the `--version` option:
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

Search for the rnaseq pipeline:

```bash
nf-core --version
```

:::

nf-core/tools has commands to help both users and developers. For users, many of the tools are designed to make it easier to run pipelines without having to touch write code yourself.

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Find out what other nf-core/tools commands are available
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

Run the `--help` option to list the options, tools for users, and tools for developers

```bash
nf-core --help
```

## Finding a nf-core workflow

There are currently 77 pipelines (March 2023) available as part of nf-core. These pipelines are at various stages of development with 47 released, 17 under development, and 13 archived. The list of available pipelines, as well as their documentation, can be explored on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/).

The `nf-core list` command can also list available nf-core pipelines with local information.

```bash
nf-core list
```

The output shows the latest pipeline version number and when that was released. It also tells you if and when a pipeline was been pulled locally and whether you have the latest version.

Unless you are actively developing pipeline code, you can use Nextflow’s built-in functionality to fetch nf-core pipelines. You can use the `nextflow pull` command to download the latest version of a remote workflow from the nf-core GitHub repository:

```bash
nextflow pull nf-core/<PIPELINE>
```

Nextflow can also fetch the pipeline code when you run it without pulling the pipeline beforehand:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/<PIPELINE>
```

> Nextflow will fetch the default git branch if a pipeline version is not specified. This will be the master branch for pipelines with a stable release.

You can explicitly reference the pipeline version number that you wish to use with the `-revision` or `-r` flag. For example:

```bash
nextflow pull nf-core/<PIPELINE> -r 1.0.0`
```

nf-core pipelines use GitHub releases to tag stable versions of the code and software, making pipeline runs reproducible. You will always be able to run a previous version of a pipeline once it is released.

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Try to pull the latest version of the `nf-core/rnaseq` pipeline directly from GitHub using Nextflow and check what version you have locally

:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}

### Solution

Use `nextflow pull` to download the `rnaseq` pipeline from the `nf-core` GitHub repository.

```bash
nextflow pull nf-core/rnaseq
```

Use `nf-core list` to view what version of the pipeline you have locally

```bash
nf-core list
```
