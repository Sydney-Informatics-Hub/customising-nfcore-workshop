### **Learning objectives**
- Use the nf-core launch web GUI to adjust parameters
- Understand different options to using launch and when each would be applicable
- Run a workflow in an offline mode 
:::

### **Construct an execution command**

Open the [nf-core launch](https://nf-co.re/launch) website and select the rnaseq pipeline from the select a pipeline menu and select pipeline release 3.11.1. Then select :rocket: **Launch**.

On the far right, unhide **Show hidden params** and then fill out the **Nextflow command-line flags** section: 

* Leave `-name` blank. Doing this will ensure a random name will be applied, like it has been for our CLI runs so far
* For `-profile`, enter `singularity,c2r8`
* Leave `-work-dir` as default 
* Toggle `-resume` to `true`

Next, fill out the input section: 

* Copy and paste the full path to the `samplesheet.csv`
* For `-outdir`, specify `Exercise6`
* Enter your email address
* Leave the other sections blank

### **Challenge**{.unlisted}

Now scroll through the remaining options, and fill in all of the parameters we have applied via our params file (including the multiqc_yaml file!)

### Solution


:::

Once you are satisified that the params are all accounted for (remember that the extra_args.config should have the quality decreased from 40 to 30), click Launch workflow

### **Launch the workflow without internet access**

Because we are on a VM, which has internet connection, we could use the first option 'If your system has an internet connection'. However, as this was covered in Part 1, we will practice with the 'no internet connection' option, which is usually the case if you are running on a HPC. Follow the instructions for this method:

1. Copy the JSON params to a file in your working directory and save it as nf-params.json

```default
{
    "input": "\/home\/ubuntu\/materials\/samplesheet.csv",
    "outdir": "Exercise6",
    "email": "georgina.samaha@sydney.edu.au",
    "fasta": "\/home\/ubuntu\/materials\/mm10_reference\/mm10_chr18.fa",
    "gtf": "\/home\/ubuntu\/materials\/mm10_reference\/mm10_chr18.gtf",
    "star_index": "\/home\/ubuntu\/materials\/mm10_reference\/STAR",
    "save_trimmed": true,
    "salmon_quant_libtype": "A",
    "extra_salmon_quant_args": "'--numBootstraps 10'",
    "save_unaligned": true,
    "config_profile_name": "pawsey_nimbus.config,extra_args.config",
    "max_cpus": 2,
    "max_memory": "6.GB",
    "multiqc_config": "\/home\/ubuntu\/run_then_launch\/multiqc_config.yaml",
    "show_hidden_params": true
}
```

2. Copy the nextflow run command and execute it in your VM
```default
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.11.1 -profile singularity,c2r8 -resume -params-file nf-params.json
```
