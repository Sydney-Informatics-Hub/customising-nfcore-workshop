This session builds on fundamental concepts learned in [Session 1](1.0_intro.md) and provides you with hands-on experience in nf-core workflow customisation. Throughout the session we will be working with data from a [published RNAseq study](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-2801-4) and the [nf-core/rnaseq pipeline](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.11.1). 

We will explore the pipeline source code and apply various customisations using a parameter file and custom configuration files. You will:

* Create these files for our case study 
* Use the nf-core tools utility 
* Run Nextflow commands to query work directories and configuration files 
* Write some custom Bash code to efficiently extract information from the source code  

Each lesson in this session will build on the previous lessons, so you can gain a deeper understanding of the customisation techniques and the impact they have on the workflow and your results :nerd_face:

::: callout-note
### Applying what you learn here to other nf-core workflows
While all activities in this session will be performed using the nf-core/rnaseq workflow, all customisation scenarios we explore are applicable to other nf-core workflows and do not require an understanding of RNAseq data processing. 
:::

### **2.0.1. Log back in to your instance**

Follow [set up instructions](../setup.html) to log back into your instance. 

### **2.0.2. Create a new work directory**

Create a new directory for all session 2 activities and move into it: 

```default
mkdir ~/session2 && cd $_
```
