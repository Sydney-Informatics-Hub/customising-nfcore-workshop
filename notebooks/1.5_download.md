Sometimes you may need to run an nf-core pipeline on a server or HPC system that has no internet connection. In this case, you will need to fetch the pipeline files and manually transfer them to your system.

To make this process easier and ensure accurate retrieval of correctly versioned code and software containers, nf-core has a `download` helper tool.

The nf-core `download` command will download both the pipeline code and the institutional nf-core/configs files. It can also optionally download any singularity image file.

If run without any arguments, the download tool will interactively prompt you for the required information. Each option has a flag, if all are supplied then it will run without any user input needed.
