Sometimes you may need to run an nf-core workflow on a server or HPC system that has no internet connection. In this case, you will need to fetch the workflow files and manually transfer them to your system.

To make this process easier and ensure accurate retrieval of correctly versioned code and software containers, nf-core has a `download` helper tool.

The nf-core `download` command will download both the workflow code and the institutional nf-core/configs files. It can also optionally download singularity image file.

If run without any arguments, the download tool will interactively prompt you for the required information. Each prompt option has a flag and if all flags are supplied then it will run without a request for any additional user input.
