During **Session 1** we will establish fundamental ideas and skills that are essential for using Nextflow and customizing the execution of nf-core workflows.

We will start by discussing the core features Nextflow and learning the fundamental commands and options for executing workflows. Next, we will then learn the core features of nf-core and its tooling. This knowledge will be applied as learn the structure of an nf-core workflow and how customize its execution. Finally we will learn more about nf-core tooling for users and how it can help you execute your workflow using best practises.

The ideas and skills you learn as a part of Session 1 will be applied during **Session 2** when you explore the source code of the `nf-core/rnaseq` workflow and customise its execution.

### **1.0.1. Create a new work directory**

It is good practice to organize projects into their own folders to make it easier to track and replicate experiments over time.

Start by creating a new directory for all of today's activities and move into it:

```bash
mkdir ~/session1 && cd $_
```
