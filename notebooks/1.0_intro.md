In Session 1 we will introduce tools, formats, concepts, and ideas that will be utilized in Session 2.

Many of the examples used in Session 1 are not "real world" examples.

### **1.0.1. Create a new work directory**

It is good practice to organize projects into their own folders to make it easier to track and replicate experiments over time.

Start by creating a new directory for all of today's activities and move into it: 

```bash
mkdir ~/session1 && cd $_
```
