In this workshop, we explore Nextflow and nf-core as powerful tools for bioinformatics data processing pipelines. Our goal for this workshop is to provide you with foundational knowledge required to understand the code base of any nf-core pipeline and responsibly apply and customise an nf-core pipelines to your own research. 

These sessions will provide you with an opportunity to develop your skills and get exposure to key concepts in Nextflow and nf-core pipelines. Even if you are already familiar with Nextflow and have some experience with nf-core pipelines, it will take you time and practice beyond this workshop to fully understand the concepts and terminology laid out here.
