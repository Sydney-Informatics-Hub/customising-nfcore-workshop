In this workshop, we explore Nextflow and nf-core as powerful tools for bioinformatics data processing pipelines. Our goal for this workshop is to provide you with foundational knowledge required to understand the code base of any nf-core pipeline and responsibly apply and customise an nf-core pipelines to your own research. 

These sessions will be a challenging but rewarding experience that will provide you with an opportunity to develop your skills and get exposure to key concepts in Nextflow. Even if you are already familiar with Nextflow and have some experience with nf-core pipelines, it will take you time and practice beyond this workshop to fully understand the concepts and terminology laid out here.
