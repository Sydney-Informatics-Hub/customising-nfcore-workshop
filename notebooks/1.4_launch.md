Nextflow workflows can have a considerable number of optional command line flags. To help manage these, you can use the `nf-core launch` command.

The command takes one argument - either the name of an nf-core workflow which will be pulled automatically or the path to a directory containing a Nextflow workflow. For example:

```bash
nf-core launch nf-core/<workflow name>
```

When running this command, you will first be asked about which version of a workflow you would like to run. Next, you will be given the choice between a web-based graphical interface or an interactive command-line wizard tool to enter the workflow parameters for your run. Both interfaces show documentation alongside each parameter and validate your inputs.

The tool uses the `nextflow_schema.json` file from a workflow to give parameter descriptions, defaults, and grouping. If no file for the workflow is found, one will be automatically generated at runtime.

Nextflow parameter variables are saved into a JSON file called `nf-params.json` and used by Nextflow with the `-params-file` flag.

The wizard will ask if you want to launch the Nextflow run. You will also be given the run command and a copy of the JSON file for you to copy and paste if you wish.
