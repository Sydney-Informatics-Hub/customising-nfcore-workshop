    "text": "Questions\n\nHow do I install a terminal or IDE application on my computer?\nHow do I log in to a Nimbus instance?\n\n\nIn this workshop series, we will be using Pawsey’s Nimbus cloud. The Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre is one of two, Tier-1, High Performance Computing facilities in Australia. Their Nimbus cloud platform is an accessible and flexible solution for bioinformatics applications that may not be suitable for large-scale HPC machines including:\n\nDeveloping and refining scalable workflows in prepration for HPC allocation applications.\nWorkflows with long runtimes that excede wall time queue limits on HPC facilities.\nComplex data-bound workflows with variable compute resource profiles that are common in bioinformatics pipelines.\n\nThe main requirements for this workshop are a personal computer with:\n\nA web broswer\nTerminal or IDE application\n\nOn this page you will find instructions on how to set up a terminal application and web browser on your computer and how to connect to Nimbus. Each participant will be provided with their instance’s IP address at the beginning of the workshop.\nTo connect to your Nimbus instance, you will need either a terminal or integrated development environment (IDE) application installed on your computer. While we recommend you use the Visual Studio Code IDE for this workshop, we have also provided directions for installing and using a terminal applications below.\n\nInstall and set up Visual Studio Code\nVisual Studio Code is a lightweight and powerful source code editor available for Windows, macOS and Linux computers.\n\nDownload Visual Studio Code for your system from here and follow the instructions for:\n\nmacOS\nLinux\nWindows\n\nOpen the VS Code application on your computer\n\n\n\nClick on the extensions button (four blocks) on the left side bar and install the remote SSH extension. Click on the blue install button.\n\n\n\nLogin via Visual Studio Code\n\nConnect to your instance with VS code by adding the host details to your ssh config file.\n\nCtrl+Shift+P to open command palette\nSelect Remote-SSH: Open SSH configuraiton file\nAdd new entry, filling out host name and identity file:\n\nHost nfcoreWorkshop\n  HostName 146.118.XX.XXX  \n  User training     \nConnect to this address\n\nCtrl+Shift+P to open command palette\nSelect Remote-SSH: Connect to Host and select name of your host\nSelect Linux from dropdown menu and then continue\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall and set up a terminal application\nThe terminal applications available to you will depend on your operating system.\n\nLinux terminals\nIf you use Linux, chances are you already know your shell and how to use it. Basically, just open your preferred terminal program and off you go!\n\n\nOS X (Mac)\nMac operating systems come with a terminal program, called Terminal. Just look for it in your Applications folder, or hit Command + Space and type ‘terminal’. You may find that other, 3rd party terminal programs are more user-friendly and powerful, like Iterm2.\n\n\nWindows\nWe recommend MobaXterm, which offers a rich experience as a full-featured X-server and terminal emulator for ssh connections, the free version is more than adequate.\nTo install and start using MobaXterm:\n\nGo to https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html\nUnder ‘Home Edition’ select the Download now button\nSelect the MobaXterm Home Edition (Installer edition)\nOnce the program is downloaded, install it as you would any other windows program\nOnce the program is installed, start the MobaXterm program\nFrom this screen, click on ‘start local terminal’ (and install Cygwin if prompted)\n\n\n\n\nLogin via Terminal\nTo log in to Nimbus, we will use a Secure Shell (SSH) connection. To connect, you need 3 things: 1. The assigned IP address of your instance (i.e. ###.###.##.###). Each participant will be provided with their instance’s IP address at the beginning of the workshop. 2. Your login name. In our case, this will be training for all participants. 3. Your password. All participants will be provided with a password at the beginning of the workshop.\nTo log in, type the following into your terminal, using your login name and the instance’s IP address:\nssh training@###.###.###.###\nYou will receive a message saying:\nThe authenticity of host 'XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (XXX.XXX.XX.XXX)' can't be established.\nRemember your host address will be different than the one above. There will then be a message saying:\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\nIf you would like to skip this message next time you log in, answer ‘yes’. It will then give a warning:\nWarning: Permanently added 'XXX.XXX.XX.XXX' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.\nEnter the password provided at the beginning of the workshop. Ask one of the demonstrators if you’ve forgotten it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay Attention\n\n\n\nWhen you type a password on the terminal, there will not be any indication the password is being entered. You’ll not see a moving cursor, or even any asterisks, or bullets. That is an intentional security mechanism used by all terminal applications and can trip us up sometimes, so be careful when typing or copying your password in.\n\n\nHaving successfully logged in, your terminal should then display something like that shown in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

    "text": "::: callout-tip\n\nObjectives\n\nUse the nf-core documentation to select appropriate parameters for a run command\nWrite and run a nf-core rnaseq command on the command line\nExplore workflow deployment and set up :::\n\n\n\nDownload the workflow code\nIt can be very easy to lose track while working on the command line, especially when we’re working with large datasets and complex commands as we do with bioinformatics workflows. To make sure we work reproducibly, we will be organising our workspace and using a local copy of the nf-core/rnaseq workflow for all exercises.\nStart by creating a new directory for all of today’s activities and move into it:\nmkdir ~/nfcore-workshop/session2 && cd $_\nThere are a number of ways to download a nf-core workflow to your machine. We recommend using git or nf-core tools. To download the workflow using the nf-core tools utility, read and follow directions here and complete the following exercise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nWhat command would you run to find and download a copy of the nf-core/rnaseq v3.10.1 workflow using the nf-core tools utility?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch for the rnaseq pipeline:\nnf-core list rnaseq\nThen, download the correct pipeline:\nnf-core download nf-core/rnaseq\nYou will be prompted to select a version. Use your arrow keys to specify 3.10.1 and hit enter.\nubuntu@georgiedev:~$ nf-core download nf-core/rnaseq\n\n                                          ,--./,-.\n          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\\\n    |\\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \\ |__) |__         }  {\n    | \\| |       \\__, \\__/ |  \\ |___     \\`-._,-`-,\n                                          `._,._,'\n\n    nf-core/tools version 2.7.2 - https://nf-co.re\n\n\n? Select release / branch: 3.10.1  [release]\n\nIn addition to the pipeline code, this tool can download software containers.\n? Download software container images: none\n\nIf transferring the downloaded files to another system, it can be convenient to have everything compressed in a single file.\n? Choose compression type: none\nINFO     Saving 'nf-core/rnaseq'\n          Pipeline revision: '3.10.1'\n          Pull containers: 'none'\n          Output directory: 'nf-core-rnaseq-3.10.1'\nINFO     Downloading workflow files from GitHub\nINFO     Downloading centralised configs from GitHub\n\n\n\nAlternatively, to download the most recent version of the workflow from it’s GitHub repository with git, run:\ngit clone https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq.git\nCheck the workflow has been downloaded:\nls -l nf-core-rnaseq-3.10.1\nInside your nf-core-rnaseq workflow directory, you should see 2 subdirectories:\ntotal 8\ndrwxrwxr-x  7 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Mar 24 06:08 configs\ndrwxrwxr-x 12 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Mar 24 06:08 workflow\n\n\nBuilding your run command\nAll nf-core workflows are provided with sensible default settings that have broad applicability and comprensive documentation that explains all available parameters. What is ‘sensible’ varies dramatically between different experiments, computing environments, and datasets, so these settings might not suit your needs. For this workshop, consider the experimental design below:\n\nWe won’t run the pseudo alignment step\nWe have chosen to use STAR to align reads\nWe have chosen to use Salmon to estimate transcript abundance\nWe only have access to 2 CPUs and 8Gb of RAM today\nWe are working with our own subset data today (including reference data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nUsing the nf-core/rnaseq documentation and the diagram above, can you decide which flags you may need to add to this command for this experiment?\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.10.1/workflow/main.nf \\\n  --input &lt;samples.tsv&gt; \\\n  -profile singularity \\\n  -with-report execution_report_exercise2_1.html \\\n  -with-trace execution_trace_exercise2_1.txt \\\n  -with-timeline timeline_exercise2_1.html \\\n  -with-dag dag_exercise2_1.png\n💡 You will need to look at the reference genome, alignment, and max job request options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven we are using STAR and Salmon as our aligner and quantification tool of choice (respectively) and it is the default choice of this workflow we will not need to provide an --aligner flag. However, if you wanted to provide this for the sake of reproducibility in case things change in the future:\n--aligner 'star_salmon'\nGiven we are providing our own subset data for this workshop, we will need to use:\n--fasta /path/to/mouse.fa\n--gtf /path/to/mouse.gtf\n--star_index /path/to/STAR\nGiven we have limited computing resources today, we will need to specify a ceiling for both memory and CPUs:\n--max_memory '6.GB'\n--max_cpus 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom reaction check in!\n\n\n\nIs everyone ok?\n👏 (clap) yes, lets move on.\n😢 (cry) no, please help.\n\n\n\n\nRun the workflow\nMake a new working directory for this lesson and move into it:\nmkdir ~/nfcore-workshop/session2/exercise1 && cd $_\nFor the sake of expediency, we are using prepared subset data for this session. All the data (including fastqs, input manifest, reference fasta, gtf, and STAR indexes) are available on the CernVM-FS file system. CernVM-FS is a read-only file system that Pawsey have used to store files such as containerised tools (Biocontainers), reference datasets, and other shared resources that are commonly used by many researchers. Take a look here for more information on bioinformatics resources provided by Pawsey on Nimbus.\nTake a quick look at the workshop data we’re working with today:\nls /path/to/aarnet-cvmfs/training/workshopMaterials\nWe need to store this path in a variable for our run command:\nmaterials=/path/to/aarnet-cvmfs/training/workshopMaterials\nNow run the workflow:\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.10.1/workflow/main.nf \\\n  --input $materials/samples.tsv \\\n  -profile singularity \\\n  --fasta $materials/mm10_chr18.fa \\\n  --gtf $materials/mm10_chr18.gtf \\\n  --star_index $materials/STAR \\\n  --max_memory '6 GB' --max_cpus 2 \\\n  --outdir ex1_results \\\n  -with-report execution_report_exercise2_1.html \\\n  -with-trace execution_trace_exercise2_1.txt \\\n  -with-timeline timeline_exercise2_1.html \\\n  -with-dag dag_exercise2_1.png\n\n\nReproducibility is a state of mind\nWe have to wait for the workflow to run (this should take ~17 mins) before we can get on with the other exercises. While we wait, lets discuss how we manage reproducibility in our own practices, and share some useful resources with one another:\n\n\n\nKey points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

The qualified name is formed by two parts - the owner name and the repository name separated by a / character. For example, if a Nextflow project foo is hosted in a GitHub repository bar at the address http://github.com/foo/bar, it could be pulled using:\nnextflow pull foo/bar\nOr by using the complete URL:\nnextflow pull http://github.com/foo/bar\nAlternatively, the Nextflow clone command can be used to download a workflow into a local directory of your choice:\nnextflow clone foo/bar &lt;your/path&gt;\nThe Nextflow run command is used to initiate the execution of a workflow script.\nnextflow run foo/bar\nWhen you run a workflow, it will look for a local file with the workflow name you’ve specified.

To help manage these, you can use the nf-core launch command.\nThe command takes one argument - either the name of an nf-core workflow which will be pulled automatically or the path to a directory containing a Nextflow workflow. For example:\nnf-core launch nf-core/&lt;workflow name&gt;\nWhen running this command, you will first be asked about which version of a workflow you would like to run. Next, you will be given the choice between a web-based graphical interface or an interactive command-line wizard tool to enter the workflow parameters for your run. Both interfaces show documentation alongside each parameter and validate your inputs.\nThe tool uses the nextflow_schema.json file from a workflow to give parameter descriptions, defaults, and grouping. If no file for the workflow is found, one will be automatically generated at runtime.\nNextflow parameter variables are saved into a JSON file called nf-params.json and used by Nextflow with the -params-file flag.\nThe wizard will ask if you want to launch the Nextflow run. You will also be given the run command and a copy of the JSON file for you to copy and paste if you wish.\n\n\nnf-core download\nSometimes you may need to run an nf-core workflow on a server or HPC system that has no internet connection. In this case, you will need to fetch the workflow files and manually transfer them to your system.\nTo make this process easier and ensure accurate retrieval of correctly versioned code and software containers, nf-core has a download helper tool.\nThe nf-core download command will download both the workflow code and the institutional nf-core/configs files. It can also optionally download singularity image file.\nnf-core download\nIf run without any arguments, the download tool will interactively prompt you for the required information. Each prompt option has a flag and if all flags are supplied then it will run without a request for any additional user input.\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

Although you won’t need to edit the code base to run an nf-core pipeline, having a basic understanding of the repository structure will help you understand how to configure its execution.\n\nnf-core pipeline structure\nnf-core pipelines start from a common template and follow the same structure.\n\n\n\nConfiguration\nWhen a pipeline script is launched, Nextflow will look for configuration files in multiple locations. As each configuration file can contain conflicting settings, the sources are ranked to decide which settings to are applied.\nConfiguration sources are reported below and listed in order of priority:\n\nParameters specified on the command line (--something value)\nParameters provided using the -params-file option\nConfig file specified using the -c my_config option\nThe config file named nextflow.config in the current directory\nThe config file named nextflow.config in the workflow project directory\nThe config file $HOME/.nextflow/config\nValues defined within the pipeline script itself (e.g., main.nf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nA --params-file must be used to define parameters.\nParameters defined in the parameter block in custom.config files WILL NOT override defaults in nextflow.config for nf-core pipelines.\n\n\n\n\nnextflow.config\nFor nf-core pipelines, the nextflow.config contains parameter defaults.

A profile is a set of configuration attributes that can be activated when launching a pipeline by using the -profile command line option.\nConfiguration profiles are defined by using the special scope profiles which group the attributes that belong to the same profile using a common prefix. For example, profiles defined in you your nextflow.config might like like:\nprofiles {\n\n    standard {\n        process.executor = 'local'\n    }\n\n    cluster {\n        process.executor = 'sge'\n        process.queue = 'long'\n        process.memory = '10GB'\n    }\n\n}\nnextflow run &lt;your script&gt; -profile standard\nAdditionally, includeConfig are used to access custom institutional profiles for different institutions that have been submitted to the nf-core repository on GitHub.\nMORE INFO + LINK\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

These workflows are designed to be modular, scalable, and portable, allowing researchers to easily adapt and run them on their own data and compute resources.\nThe nf-core community comprises a diverse group of bioinformaticians, developers, and researchers from around the world who collaborate on developing and maintaining a growing collection of high-quality workflows. These workflows cover a range of applications, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metagenomics.\nOne of the key benefits of nf-core is that it promotes open development, testing, and peer review, ensuring that the workflows are robust, well-documented, and validated against real-world datasets. This helps to increase the reliability and reproducibility of bioinformatics analyses and ultimately enables researchers to accelerate their scientific discoveries.\nnf-core is published in Nature Biotechnology!
