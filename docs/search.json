    "text": "In this workshop series, we will be using Pawsey‚Äôs Nimbus cloud. The Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre is one of two, Tier-1, High Performance Computing facilities in Australia. Their Nimbus cloud platform is an accessible and flexible solution for bioinformatics applications that may not be suitable for large-scale HPC machines including:\n\nDeveloping and refining scalable workflows in prepration for HPC allocation applications.\nWorkflows with long runtimes that excede wall time queue limits on HPC facilities.\nComplex data-bound workflows with variable compute resource profiles that are common in bioinformatics pipelines.\n\nThe main requirements for this workshop are a personal computer with:\n\nA web broswer\nTerminal or IDE application\n\nOn this page you will find instructions on how to set up a terminal application and web browser on your computer and how to connect to Nimbus. Each participant will be provided with their instance‚Äôs IP address at the beginning of the workshop.\nTo connect to your Nimbus instance, you will need either a terminal or integrated development environment (IDE) application installed on your computer. While we recommend you use the Visual Studio Code IDE for this workshop, we have also provided directions for installing and using a terminal applications below.\n\nOption 1: Install and set up Visual Studio Code\nVisual Studio Code is a lightweight and powerful source code editor available for Windows, macOS and Linux computers.\n\nDownload Visual Studio Code for your system from here and follow the instructions for:\n\nmacOS\nLinux\nWindows\n\nOpen the VS Code application on your computer\n\n\n\nClick on the extensions button (four blocks) on the left side bar and install the remote SSH extension. Click on the blue install button.\n\n\n\nInstall the Live Server extension. Click on the blue install button.\n\n\n\nLogin via Visual Studio Code\n\nConnect to your instance with VS code by adding the host details to your ssh config file.\n\nCtrl+Shift+P to open command palette\nSelect Remote-SSH: Open SSH configuraiton file\nAdd new entry, filling out host name and identity file:\n\nHost nfcoreWorkshop\n  HostName 146.118.XX.XXX  \n  User training     \nConnect to this address\n\nCtrl+Shift+P to open command palette\nSelect Remote-SSH: Connect to Host and select name of your host\nSelect Linux from dropdown menu and then continue\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2: Install and set up a terminal application\nThe terminal applications available to you will depend on your operating system.\n\nLinux terminals\nIf you use Linux, chances are you already know your shell and how to use it. Basically, just open your preferred terminal program and off you go!\n\n\nOS X (Mac)\nMac operating systems come with a terminal program, called Terminal. Just look for it in your Applications folder, or hit Command + Space and type ‚Äòterminal‚Äô. You may find that other, 3rd party terminal programs are more user-friendly and powerful, like Iterm2.\n\n\nWindows\nWe recommend MobaXterm, which offers a rich experience as a full-featured X-server and terminal emulator for ssh connections, the free version is more than adequate.\nTo install and start using MobaXterm:\n\nGo to https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html\nUnder ‚ÄòHome Edition‚Äô select the Download now button\nSelect the MobaXterm Home Edition (Installer edition)\nOnce the program is downloaded, install it as you would any other windows program\nOnce the program is installed, start the MobaXterm program\nFrom this screen, click on ‚Äòstart local terminal‚Äô (and install Cygwin if prompted)\n\n\n\n\nLogin via Terminal\nTo log in to Nimbus, we will use a Secure Shell (SSH) connection. To connect, you need 3 things: 1. The assigned IP address of your instance (i.e.¬†###.###.##.###). Each participant will be provided with their instance‚Äôs IP address at the beginning of the workshop. 2. Your login name. In our case, this will be training for all participants. 3. Your password. All participants will be provided with a password at the beginning of the workshop.\nTo log in, type the following into your terminal, using your login name and the instance‚Äôs IP address:\nssh training@###.###.###.###\nYou will receive a message saying:\nThe authenticity of host 'XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (XXX.XXX.XX.XXX)' can't be established.\nRemember your host address will be different than the one above. There will then be a message saying:\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\nIf you would like to skip this message next time you log in, answer ‚Äòyes‚Äô. It will then give a warning:\nWarning: Permanently added 'XXX.XXX.XX.XXX' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.\nEnter the password provided at the beginning of the workshop. Ask one of the demonstrators if you‚Äôve forgotten it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay Attention\n\n\n\nWhen you type a password on the terminal, there will not be any indication the password is being entered. You‚Äôll not see a moving cursor, or even any asterisks, or bullets. That is an intentional security mechanism used by all terminal applications and can trip us up sometimes, so be careful when typing or copying your password in.\n\n\nHaving successfully logged in, your terminal should then display something like that shown in the figure below:\n\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

    "title": "Introduction to Nextflow",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Objectives\n\n\n\n\nLearn about the core features of Nextflow.\nLearn fundamental Nextflow options and commands.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1. What is Nextflow?\n\nNextflow is a workflow orchestration engine and domain-specific language (DSL) that makes it easy to write data-intensive computational workflows.\nIt is designed around the idea that the Linux platform is the lingua franca of data science. Linux provides many simple but powerful command-line and scripting tools that, when chained together, facilitate complex data manipulations.\nNextflow extends this approach, adding the ability to define complex program interactions and a high-level parallel computational environment, based on the dataflow programming model.\nNextflow‚Äôs core features are:\n\nWorkflow portability and reproducibility\nScalability of parallelization and deployment\nIntegration of existing tools, systems, and industry standards\n\nWhether you are working with genomics data or other large and complex data sets, Nextflow can help you to streamline your workflow and improve your productivity.\n\n\n1.1.2. Processes and Channels\nIn Nextflow, processes and channels are the fundamental building blocks of a workflow.\n\nA process is a unit of execution that represents a single computational step in a workflow. It is defined as a block of code that typically performs a one specific task and specifies its input and outputs, as well as any directives and conditional statements required for its execution. Processes can be written in any language that can be executed from the command line, such as Bash, Python, or R.\nProcesses in are executed independently (i.e., they do not share a common writable state) as tasks and can run in parallel, allowing for efficient utilization of computing resources. Nextflow automatically manages the data dependencies between processes, ensuring that each process is executed only when its input data is available and all of its dependencies have been satisfied.\nA channel is an asynchronous first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue that is used by Nextflow to join processes together. Channels allow data to passed between processes and can be used to manage data, parallelize tasks, and structure workflows. Any process can define one or more channels as an input and output and the interaction between these processes, and ultimately the workflow execution flow itself, is implicitly defined by these declarations.\nImportantly, processes can be parameterized to allow for flexibility in their behavior and to enable their reuse in and between workflows.\n\n\n1.1.3. Execution abstraction\nWhile a process defines what command or script is executed, the executor determines how and where the script is run.\nNextflow provides an abstraction between the workflow‚Äôs functional logic and the underlying execution system. This abstraction allows users to define a workflow once and run it on different computing platforms without having to modify the workflow definition. Nextflow provides a variety of built-in execution options, such as local execution, HPC cluster execution, and cloud-based execution, and allows users to easily switch between these options using command-line arguments.\n\nIf not specified, processes are executed on your local computer. The local executor is useful for workflow development and testing purposes. However, for real-world computational workflows, a high-performance computing (HPC) or cloud platform is often required.\nYou can find a full list of supported executors as well as how to configure them here.\n\n\n1.1.4. Nextflow CLI\nNextflow implements a declarative domain-specific language (DSL) that simplifies the writing of complex data analysis workflows as an extension of a general-purpose programming language. As a concise DSL Nextflow handles recurrent use cases while having the flexibility and power to handle corner cases.\nNextflow is an extension of the Groovy programming language which, in turn, is a super-set of the Java programming language. Groovy can be thought of as ‚ÄúPython for Java‚Äù and simplifies the code.\nNextflow provides a robust command line interface for the management and execution of workflows. Nextflow can be used on any POSIX compatible system (Linux, OS X, etc). It requires Bash 3.2 (or later) and Java 11 (or later, up to 18) to be installed.\nNextflow is distributed as a self-installing package and does not require any special installation procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to install Nextflow\n\n\n\nIf you do not already have Nextflow available, it can be installed using a few easy steps:\n\nDownload the executable package using either wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash or curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash\nMake the binary executable on your system by running chmod +x nextflow.\nMove the nextflow file to a directory accessible by your $PATH variable, e.g, mv nextflow ~/bin/\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5.Nextflow options and commands\nNextflow provides a robust command line interface for the management and execution of workflows. The top-level interface consists of options and commands.\nA list of options and commands can be viewed using the -h option:\nnextflow -h\n\nOptions for a specific command can also be viewed by appending the help option to a Nextflow command. For example, the run command:\nnextflow run -h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nFind out which version of Nextflow you are using using the version option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe version of Nextflow you are using can be printed using the -v option:\nnextflow -v\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.6. Managing your environment\nYou can use environment variables to control the Nextflow runtime and the underlying Java virtual machine. These variables can be exported before running a workflow and will be interpreted by Nextflow. For most users, Nextflow will work without setting any environment variables. However, to improve reproducibility and your optimize your resources, you will likely benefit from setting some variables.\nFor example, for consistency, it is good practice to pin the version of Nextflow you are using when running a workflow using the NXF_VER variable:\nexport NXF_VER=&lt;version number&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nPin the version of Nextflow to 22.04.5 using the NXF_VER environmental variable and check that it has been applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nExport the version using the NXF_VER environmental variable:\nexport NXF_VER=22.04.5\nCheck that the new version has been applied using the -v option:\nnextflow -v\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, if you are using a shared resource, you may also consider including paths to where software is stored and can be accessed using the NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR or the NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR variables:\nexport NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR=&lt;custom/path/to/conda/cache&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nCreate a new folder with the path /home/training/singularity_cache to store your singularity images and export its location using the NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR environmental variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a new folder for your singularity images:\nmkdir /home/training/singularity_cache\nExport your new folder as your cache directory for singularity images using the NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR environmental variable:\nexport NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/home/training/singularity_cache\nSingularity images downloaded by workflow executions will now be stored in this directory.\n\n\n\nYou may want to include these, or other environmental variables, in your .bashrc file (or alternate) that is loaded when you log in so you don‚Äôt need to export variables every session. A complete list of environmental variables can be found here.\n\n\n1.1.7. Executing a workflow\nNextflow seamlessly integrates with code repositories such as GitHub. This feature allows you to manage your project code and use public Nextflow workflows quickly, consistently, and transparently.\nThe Nextflow pull command will download a workflow from a hosting platform into your global cache $HOME/.nextflow/assets folder.\nIf you are pulling a project hosted in a remote code repository, you can specify its qualified name or the repository URL. The qualified name is formed by two parts - the owner name and the repository name separated by a / character. For example, if a Nextflow project foo is hosted in a GitHub repository bar at the address http://github.com/foo/bar, it could be pulled using:\nnextflow pull foo/bar\nOr by using the complete URL:\nnextflow pull http://github.com/foo/bar\nAlternatively, the Nextflow clone command can be used to download a workflow into a local directory of your choice:\nnextflow clone foo/bar &lt;your/path&gt;\nThe Nextflow run command is used to initiate the execution of a workflow :\nnextflow run foo/bar\nIt is worth noting that when you run a workflow, it will look for a local file with the workflow name you‚Äôve specified. If that file does not exist, it will look for a public repository with the same name on GitHub (unless otherwise specified). If it is found, Nextflow will automatically pull the workflow to your global cache and execute it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nRun the hello workflow directly from nextflow-io GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the nextflow-io/hello workflow:\nnextflow run nextflow-io/hello\n\n\n\n\nMore information about the Nextflow run command can be found here.\n\n\n1.1.8. Executing a revision\nWhen a Nextflow workflow is created or updated using GitHub (or another code repository), a new revision is created. Each revision is identified by a unique number, which can be used to track changes made to the workflow and to ensure that the same version of the workflow is used consistently across different runs.\nThe Nextflow info command can be used to view workflow properties, such as the project name, repository, local path, main script, and revisions. The * indicates which revision of the workflow you have stickied and will be executed when using the run command.\nnextflow info &lt;workflow&gt;\nIt is recommended that you use the revision flag every time you execute a workflow to ensure that the version is correct. To use a specific revision, you simply need to add it to the command line with the --revision or -r flag. For example, to run a workflow with the v1.0 revision, you would use the following command:\nnextflow run &lt;workflow&gt; -r v1.0\nNextflow provides built-in support for version control using Git, which allows users to easily manage and track changes made to a workflow over time. A revision can be a git branch, tag or commit SHA number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nRun the hello workflow directly from nextflow-io GitHub using the v1.1 revision tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the nextflow-io/hello workflow with the revision -r option:\nnextflow run nextflow-io/hello -r v1.1\n\nThe warning shown above is expected. The warning is shown because the v1.1 workflow revision was written using an older version of Nextflow that uses the depreciated echo method.\n\n\n\nIf your local version of a workflow is not the latest you be shown a warning and will be required to use a revision flag when executing the workflow. You can update a workflow with the Nextflow pull command.\n\n\n1.1.9. Nextflow log\nIt is important to keep a record of the commands you have run to generate your results. Nextflow helps with this by creating storing metadata and logs about the run in hidden files and folders in your current directory (unless otherwise specified). While this data can be used by Nextflow to generate reports, the metadata can also be queried using the Nextflow log command:\nnextflow log\nThis command has multiple options to facilitate the queries and is especially useful while debugging a pipeline and while inspecting pipeline execution metadata. You can view all of the possible log options with -h flag:\nnextflow log -h\nTo query a specific execution you can use the RUN NAME or a SESSION ID:\nnextflow log &lt;run name&gt;\nTo get more information, you can use the -f option with named fields. For example:\nnextflow log &lt;run name&gt; -f 'process,hash,duration'\nThere are many other fields you can query. You can view a full list of fields with the -l option:\nnextflow log -l\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nUse the log command to view with process, hash, and script fields for your tasks from your most recent Nextflow execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the log command to get a list of you recent executions:\nnextflow log\n\nQuery the process, hash, and script using the -f option for the most recent run:\nnextflow log crazy_faggin -f 'process,hash,script'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.10. Execution cache and resume\nTask execution caching and check-pointing is an essential feature of modern workflow managers. As such, Nextflow provides an automated caching mechanism for every execution. When using the Nextflow -resume option, successfully completed tasks from previous executions are skipped and the previously cached results are used in downstream tasks.\nNextflow caching mechanism works by assigning a unique ID to each task. The task unique ID is generated as a 128-bit hash value composing the the complete file path, file size, and last modified timestamp. These ID‚Äôs are used to create a separate execution directory where the tasks are executed and the results are stored. Nextflow will take care of the inputs and outputs in these folders for you.\nA multi-step workflow is required to demonstrate cache and resume. The Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo workflow was created with the nf-core create command and has the same structure as nf-core workflows. It is a toy example with 3 processes:\n\nSAMPLESHEET_CHECK\n\nExecutes a custom python script to check the input sample sheet is valid.\n\nFASTQC\n\nExecutes the fastqc command using the .fastq.gz files from the sample sheet.\n\nMULTIQC\n\nExecutes multiqc using the fastqc reports.\n\n\nThe Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo workflow is more advanced than the nextflow-io/hello workflow that has been shown previously. It uses real data and bioinformatics software and requires additional configuration to run successfully. To run this example you will need to include two profiles in your execution command. Profiles are sets of configuration options that can be accessed by Nextflow and will be explained in greater detail during configuring nf-core workflows section of the workshop.\nTo run this workflow, both the test profile and a software management profile (such as singularity) are required:\nnextflow run Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo -profile test,singularity\"\nThe command line output will print something like this:\n\nRunning this workflow will create a work directory and a my_results directory with selected results files.\nIn this example, the hexadecimal numbers, such as ff/21abfa, identify the unique task execution. These numbers are also the prefix of the work directories where each task is executed. You can inspect the files produced by a task by looking inside the work directory and using these numbers to find the task-specific execution path:\nls -la work/ff/21abfa87cc7cdec037ce4f36807d32/\nThe files that have been selected for publication in the my_results folder can also be explored:\nls my_results\nIf you were to look inside the work directory a FASTQC task, you will find the files that were staged and created when this task was executed. You will also hidden .command files. You will also see that Nextflow created symlinks for your files rather than creating a new copy of each file in the task directories:\n\nThe FASTQC process runs four times, executing in four different work directories for each set of inputs. Therefore, in the previous example the work directory [1a/3c54ed] represents just one of the four directories that were processed. To print all the relevant paths to the screen, use the -ansi-log option can be used:\nnextflow run Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo -profile test,singularity -ansi-log false\nIt‚Äôs very likely you will execute a workflow multiple times as you are finding the parameters that best suit your data. As such, you can save a lot of spaces (and time) by resuming a workflow from the last step that was completed successfully and/or unmodified after your changes. By adding the -resume option to your run command you can use the cache rather than re-running tasks:\nnextflow run Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo -profile test,singularity -resume\nIf you run the Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo workflow again without any changes you will see that the workflow will use the cache rather than executing tasks again:\n\nIn practical terms, the workflow is executed from the beginning. However, before launching the execution of a process, Nextflow uses the task unique ID to check if the work directory already exists and that it contains a valid command exit state with the expected output files. If this condition is satisfied, the task execution is skipped and previously computed results are used as the process results.\nNotably, the -resume functionality is very sensitive. Even touching a file in the work directory can invalidate the cache.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nInvalidate the cache by touching a .fastq.gz file in a FASTQC task work directory. Run the workflow again with the -resume option to show that the cache has been invalidated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nExecute the workflow for the first time (if you have not already).\nnextflow run Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo -profile test,singularity\nUse the task ID shown for the FASTQC process and use it to find and touch a the sample1_R1.fastq.gz file. Your path will likely be different to the path shown here:\ntouch work/ff/21abfa87cc7cdec037ce4f36807d32/sample1_R1.fastq.gz\nExecute the workflow again with the -resume command option:\nnextflow run Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo -profile test,singularity -resume\nYou should see that the cache of 2 of 4 tasks for the FASTQC process and the MULTIQC process were invalid.\n4 of 4, cached: 2 ‚úî\nWhy did this happen?\nIn this example, the cache of two FASTQC tasks were invalid. The sample1_R1.fastq.gz file is used by in the samplesheet twice. Thus, touching the symlink for this file and changing the date of last modification disrupted two task executions.\n\n\n\nYour work directory can get very big very quickly (especially if you are using full sized datasets). It is beneficial to clean your the cache regularly. Rather than removing the work folder with all of it‚Äôs contents, the Nextflow clean function allows you to selectively remove data associated with specific runs.\nnextflow clean -help\n\nThe -after, -before, and -but options are all very useful to select specific runs to clean. The -dry-run option is also very useful to see which files will be removed if you were to -force the clean command.\n\n\n1.1.11. Listing and dropping cached workflows\nOver time you might want to remove a stored workflows. Nextflow also has functionality to help you to view and remove workflows that have been pulled locally. The Nextflow list command prints the projects stored in your global cache $HOME/.nextflow/assets. These are the workflows that were pulled when you executed either of the Nextflow pull or run commands:\nnextflow list\nIf you want to remove a workflow from your cache you can remove it using the Nextflow drop command:\nnextflow drop &lt;workflow&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nView your cached workflows with the Nextflow list command and remove the nextflow-io/hello workflow with the drop command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nList your workflow assets:\nnextflow list\nDrop the nextflow-io/hello workflow:\nnextflow drop nextflow-io/hello\nCheck it has been removed:\nnextflow list\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey points\n\n\n\n\nNextflow is a workflow orchestration engine and domain-specific language (DSL) that makes it easy to write data-intensive computational workflows.\nEnvironment variables can be used to control your Nextflow runtime and the underlying Java virtual machine.\nNextflow supports version control and has automatic integrations with online code repositories.\nNextflow will cache your runs and they can be resumed with the -resume option.\nYou can manage workflows with Nextflow commands (e.g., pull, clone, list, and drop).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

To help manage these, you can use the nf-core launch command.\nThe command takes one argument - either the name of an nf-core workflow which will be pulled automatically or the path to a directory containing a Nextflow workflow:\nnf-core launch nf-core/&lt;workflow&gt;\nWhen running this command, you will first be asked about which version of a workflow you would like to run. Next, you will be given the choice between a web-based graphical interface or an interactive command-line wizard tool to enter the workflow parameters for your run. Both interfaces show documentation alongside each parameter, will generate a run ID, and will validate your inputs.\n\nThe launch tool uses the nextflow_schema.json file from a workflow to give parameter descriptions, defaults, and grouping. If no file for the workflow is found, one will be automatically generated at runtime.\nThe launch tool will save your parameter variables as a JSON file called nf-params.json and will suggest an execution command that includes the -params-file flag and your new nf-params.json file.\nThe wizard will ask if you want to launch the Nextflow run. You will also be given the run command and a copy of the JSON file for you to copy and paste if you wish.\nAny profiles or Nextflow options that are set using the wizard will also be included in your run command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nTry to run the nf-core/rnaseq workflow with the nf-core launch command. Use the latest version of the workflow with the the test and singularity profiles, and name your output directory results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the nf-core launch command for the nf-core/rnaseq workflow and follow the prompts:\nnf-core launch nf-core/rnaseq\nYour final run command should look like this:\nnextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 3.11.1 -profile test,singularity -params-file nf-params.json\nYour nf-params.json file should look like this:\n{\n    \"outdir\": \"results\"\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 nf-core download\nSometimes you may need to run an nf-core workflow on a server or HPC system that has no internet connection. In this case, you will need to fetch the workflow files and manually transfer them to your system.\nTo make this process easier and ensure accurate retrieval of correctly versioned code and software containers, nf-core has the download helper tool.\nThe nf-core download command will download both the workflow code and the institutional nf-core/configs files. It can also optionally download singularity image file.\nnf-core download\nIf run without any arguments, the download tool will interactively prompt you for the required information. Each prompt option has a flag and if all flags are supplied then it will run without a request for any additional user input:\n\nPipeline name\n\nName of workflow you would like to download.\n\nPipeline revision\n\nSelect the revision you would like to download.\n\nPull containers\n\nChoose if you would like to download Singularity images.\nThis will only work if you have Singularity installed.\n\nChoose compression type\n\nChoose compression type for Singularity images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey points\n\n\n\n\nPoint 1\nPoint 2\nPoint 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

Introducing the case study\nWe are working with a subset dataset from a knockout mouse model study by Corley et al.¬†(2016). The authors used the mouse model to simulate the role of a specific gene (Gtf2ird1) in Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS), a rare genetic disease in humans.\nIn this session, we are performing the pre-processing steps to generate a set of files that can be used to perform differential expression analysis. In deciding whether or not the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline was suitable for reproducing the results presented in this study, we considered a number of factors, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsideration\nQuestions to ask of our experiment\nWhy\n\n\n\n\nSize of dataset\nNumber of samples and data volume\nScale of data impacts computational efficiency of the pipeline\n\n\nInput data\nType of RNA sequenced, availability of reference files\nDetermines if we meet input requirements of pipeline\n\n\nResearch questions\nSuitability of pipeline outputs\nNeed the right processed data for downstream analysis\n\n\nComputational resources\nCPU, memory, RAM available and minimum requirements of the pipeline\nDetermines if we have enough resources to run the pipeline\n\n\nTool preferences\nSuitability of each tool, required inputs and outputs\nPipeline offers multiple choices for some stages, determines which choices we make\n\n\n\nWe consulted the nf-core/rnaseq documentation to confirm that nf-core/rnaseq is a suitable pipeline for our application. We have sketched out our experimental design, those considerations, and our choices below.\n\n\n\n2.1.2. Download the pipeline code\nStart by creating a new directory for all of today‚Äôs activities and move into it:\nmkdir ~/session2 && cd $_\nWe recommend that you keep a local copy of a pipeline‚Äôs code for the sake of reproducibility and record keeping. There are a number of ways to download a nf-core pipeline to your machine. We recommend using either the nf-core tools utility to download a pipeline for offline use or git. Today, we will download most recent version (3.11.1) of the pipeline using the nf-core tools utility, like we did in Session 1.\nTake a look at the download options available to us:\nnf-core download --help\n\nRun the following command:\nnf-core download rnaseq \\\n  --revision 3.11.1 \\\n  --outdir ~/session2/nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1 \\\n  --container singularity \\\n  --compress none \\\n  --singularity-cache-only\nBy default the most recent version of a pipeline will be downloaded. We used:\n\n--revision/-r to specify the pipeline version\n--outdir/-o to download the pipeline to our current working directory\n--container/-c to download software containers with Singularity\n--singularity-cache-only to cache and not copy containers to our output directory\n--compress/-x none to not compress downloaded files\n\nYou will be prompted to define a Singularity cache directory to store container images ($NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR). Specify the path we used in Session 1:\nexport NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/home/training/singularity_cache\nThe nf-core tools utility will download the pipeline files and centralised configs but not the containers, given they already exist in our specified cache.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternate installation method\n\n\n\n\n\nIn situations where you might not wish to use the nf-core tools utility, download the nf-core/rnaseq source code from it‚Äôs GitHub repository with git.\nClone the nf-core/rnaseq repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq.git\n\n‚õî BEWARE ‚õî this method will download a copy of the pipeline with a different directory name and slightly different structure. If you choose to use this method, you will need to adjust some paths specified in the upcoming lessons accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nInside your nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1 workflow directory, you should see 2 subdirectories:\nls -l nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1\ntotal 8\ndrwxrwxr-x  7 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Apr 21 02:08 configs\ndrwxrwxr-x 12 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Apr 21 02:08 workflow\nRemember, as we ran the download command, a number of INFO logs were printed to the screen. The workflow files from GitHub were downloaded to the workflow directory and the centralised configs from GitHub were downloaded to the configs directory:\n\nFor this session we will be working with the workflow directory:\nls -l nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow\ntotal 216\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 58889 Apr 21 02:08 CHANGELOG.md\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu  9681 Apr 21 02:08 CITATIONS.md\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu  9078 Apr 21 02:08 CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu  1096 Apr 21 02:08 LICENSE\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 10002 Apr 21 02:08 README.md\ndrwxrwxr-x 3 ubuntu ubuntu  4096 Apr 21 02:08 assets\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu  4096 Apr 21 02:08 bin\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu  4096 Apr 21 02:08 conf\ndrwxrwxr-x 3 ubuntu ubuntu  4096 Apr 21 02:08 docs\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu  4096 Apr 21 02:08 lib\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu  2736 Apr 21 02:08 main.nf\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 ubuntu ubuntu  4096 Apr 21 02:08 modules\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 13970 Apr 21 02:08 modules.json\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 10847 Apr 21 02:08 nextflow.config\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu 42576 Apr 21 02:08 nextflow_schema.json\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu   359 Apr 21 02:08 pyproject.toml\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 ubuntu ubuntu  4096 Apr 21 02:08 subworkflows\n-rwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu  1684 Apr 21 02:08 tower.yml\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu  4096 Apr 21 02:08 workflows\nWe explored the standard nf-core workflow directory structure in Session 1. The most important files and directories for this session are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nImportance\n\n\n\n\nconf/\nContains standard configuration files for various profiles that build on global settings set by nextflow.config\n\n\nmain.nf\nThe executable Nextflow script that defines the structure and flow of the workflow. It calls workflows/rnaseq.nf\n\n\nmodules/\nContains Nextflow processes used by the workflow. They are called by the main.nf file\n\n\nworkflows/rnaseq.nf\nAll the modules, subworkflows, channels, workflow structure for running the rnaseq pipeline\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3. Build your run command\nAll nf-core pipelines are provided with sensible default settings that have broad applicability and comprensive documentation that explains all available parameters. On the command line you can view these options by running:\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/main.nf --help\nNotice at the bottom of the print out, there is:\n!! Hiding 24 params, use --show_hidden_params to show them !!\nThree additional parameter sections are hidden from view. This is because they are less commonly used. To view all the pipeline run options on the command line, run:\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/main.nf --help --show_hidden_params\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyphens matter!\n\n\n\nHyphens matter when it comes to parameter flags in nf-core pipelines! Nextflow command-line parameters use one (-), whereas pipeline-specific parameters use two (--). For example: -profile is a Nextflow parameter, while --input is an nf-core parameter.\n\n\nWe need to customise the default run command, given the following considerations based on our experiment plan above:\n\nWe don‚Äôt need to run the pseudo alignment step (Stage 3)\nWe have chosen to use STAR to align reads\nWe have chosen to use Salmon to estimate transcript abundance\nWe have access to 2 CPUs and 8 Gb of RAM today\nWe have provided the requisite reference data (fasta, gtf, STAR index) for our input dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nCan you use the nf-core/rnaseq parameters documentation (or the --help flag) and the important considerations above to identify flags we will need to apply to our first workflow run? Don‚Äôt worry about the files required for these flags just yet.\n\nWhat flag would we use to specify our chosen alignment and quantification method?\nWhat flags would we use to specify maximum CPU and memory resources?\nWhat flags would we use to specify the provided fasta, gtf, and STAR index files?\n\nüí° HINT: You will need to look at the reference genome, alignment, and max job request sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven we are using STAR and Salmon as our aligner and quantification tool of choice (respectively) and it is the default choice of this pipeline we do not need to provide an --aligner flag. However, if you wanted to provide this for the sake of reproducibility in case things change in the future:\n\n--aligner 'star_salmon'\n\nGiven we have limited computing resources today, we will need to specify a ceiling for both memory and CPUs:\n\n--max_memory '6.GB' \n--max_cpus 2 \n\nGiven we are providing our own subset data for this workshop, we will need to use:\n\n--fasta /path/to/mouse.fa  \n--gtf /path/to/mouse.gtf \n--star_index /path/to/STAR\n\n\n\nFor the sake of expediency, we are using prepared subset data for this session. All the data (including fastqs, reference fasta, gtf, and STAR indexes) are already available on an external file system called CernVM-FS that we can access from our Nimbus instances. Take a look at the files:\n#ls -l /path/to/aarnet-cvmfs/training/workshopMaterials\n\n#Workaround for testing (data not yet on cvmfs)\nwget -O nfcore_materials.tar.gz https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/gIBdDhKEwfq2j58/download\ntar -zxvf nfcore_materials.tar.gz\nls -l ~/session2/materials\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Feb 14 05:36 fastqs\ndrwxrwxr-x 3 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Feb 14 05:46 mm10_reference\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  641 Feb 16 05:57 samplesheet.csv\nA sample sheet is a standard input requirement for nf-core pipelines. This sheet specifies:\n\nThe sample name\nRelevant input files for each sample\nOther metadata for each sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nNow that we have the path to our raw sequence files, create the input sample sheet following the nf-core/rnaseq documentation. Your input file will need to be comma-delimited and have the following columns:\n\nsample: custom sample name (use the SRR IDs)\nfastq1: full path to read 1 fastq.gz file\nfastq2: full path to read 2 fastq.gz file\nstrandedness: for this lesson, all should be labelled as forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSave this file as samplesheet.csv:\nsample,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness\nSRR3473989,/home/ubuntu/session2/materials/fastqs/SRR3473989_selected.fastq.gz,,forward\nSRR3473988,/home/ubuntu/session2/materials/fastqs/SRR3473988_selected.fastq.gz,,forward\nSRR3473987,/home/ubuntu/session2/materials/fastqs/SRR3473987_selected.fastq.gz,,forward\nSRR3473985,/home/ubuntu/session2/materials/fastqs/SRR3473985_selected.fastq.gz,,forward\nSRR3473986,/home/ubuntu/session2/materials/fastqs/SRR3473986_selected.fastq.gz,,forward\nSRR3473984,/home/ubuntu/session2/materials/fastqs/SRR3473984_selected.fastq.gz,,forward\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4. Run the pipeline\nWe need to store the path to our input and reference data in a variable for our run command:\nmaterials=/home/ubuntu/session2/materials\nGiven we already downloaded the containers, we will point the pipeline to where it can find them so it doesn‚Äôt waste time trying to download them all over again. We can do this by setting the NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR environmental variable:\nexport NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/home/ubuntu/singularity_cache/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNextflow has environmental variables!\n\n\n\nEnvironmental variables are used to store information that can be accessed by different programs and scripts running on the system. Nextflow has a number of environmental variables that can be used to override default Nextflow and pipeline behaviours. You can set them on the command line or by using env scopes when writing Nextflow.\n\n\nNow run the pipeline, with the necessary flags and the samplesheet.csv file you just created:\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/main.nf \\\n    --input samplesheet.csv \\\n    -profile singularity \\\n    --fasta $materials/mm10_reference/mm10_chr18.fa \\\n    --gtf $materials/mm10_reference/mm10_chr18.gtf \\\n    --star_index $materials/mm10_reference/STAR \\\n    --max_memory '6.GB' \\\n    --max_cpus 2 \\\n    --outdir Lesson-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nü§∑ Zoom check-in! ü§∑\n\n\n\nIs everyone ok?\nYes, move on üëè :clap:\nNo, help! üò¢ :cry:\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5. Examine the outputs\nOnce your pipeline has completed, you should see this message printed to your terminal:\n-[nf-core/rnaseq] Pipeline completed successfully with skipped sampl(es)-\n-[nf-core/rnaseq] Please check MultiQC report: 6/6 samples failed strandedness check.-\nCompleted at: 21-Apr-2023 03:58:56\nDuration    : 13m 59s\nCPU hours   : 0.4\nSucceeded   : 200\nThe pipeline ran successfully, however note the warning about all samples having failed the strandedness check.

Throughout the session we will be working with a case study to apply an nf-core workflow. Each lesson will build on the previous one, so you can gain a deeper understanding of the customisation techniques and the impact they have on the workflow and your results. We will be exploring source code of the nf-core/rnaseq workflow and apply customisations using a parameter file and custom configuration files.\nYou will be writing these files using Nextflow and YAML languages and also running some Nextflow commands and custom Bash code to efficiently extract information from the source code ü§ì.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile all activities in this session will be performed using the nf-core/rnaseq workflow, all customisation scenarios we explore are applicable to other nf-core workflows and do not require an understanding of RNAseq data processing.\n\n\n\n2.0.1. How to approach open source software communities\nAs with all open source bioinformatics resources, nf-core workflows may not suit all applications. It is important that you understand the needs of your dataset and research questions before deciding on a workflow. nf-core is a community effort powered by life scientists and software developers, who volunteer their time to build, maintain, and support workflows. All nf-core workflows are provided with sensible default settings that have broad applicability and comprensive documentation that explains all available parameters. What is ‚Äòsensible‚Äô varies dramatically between different experiments, computing environments, and datasets, so these settings might not suit your needs. We recommend approaching the application and customisation of nf-core workflows with the following framework:\nDIAGRAM OF NF-CORE COMMUNITY FEATURE - IMPLICATION FOR WORKFLOWS - Q TO ASK - OUR RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n\n2.0.2.

    "text": "Objectives\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand formatting requirements of a config file\nWrite a custom config file for your local environment that overwrites default workflow settings\nRun a workflow using the custom config file and appropriate Nextflow flag\nUse an alternative container source for a workflow process\n\n\n\n\nNextflow‚Äôs portability is enabled by its ability to separate workflow implementation from the configuration settings required to execute it. In this lesson we will use configuration files to define specifications required to execute an nf-core pipeline on our compute environment. While nf-core workflows are designed to be portable and work out of the box, sometimes you will need to customise the workflow‚Äôs configuration so that it can run on your environment. The nf-core developer community currently offer a number of ways to configure nf-core workflows.\n\n2.3.1. Default nf-core configuration\nRecall that when a main.nf file is run for any Nextflow workflow, Nextflow looks for configuration files in multiple locations to determine how to execute the workflow and its processes. One of the files Nextflow will always look for is nextflow.config. Currently, all nf-core workflows use a nextflow.config file and a conf/base.config file to define the default execution settings and parameters of a workflow.\nLet‚Äôs take a look at the nf-core/rnaseq nextflow.config file:\ncat nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/nextflow.config\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the default aligner parameter being applied?\nWhat default max memory, cpu, and walltime resources have been specified?\nWhat config file is loaded by default for all nf-core workflows?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the Global default params {} section, on line 58 of the nextflow.config under // Alignment:\n\naligner = 'star_salmon'\n\nInside the Global default params {} section, on lines 120-124 of the nextflow.config under // Max resource options:\n\nmax_memory = '128.GB'\nmax_cpus   = 16\nmax_time   = '240.h'\n\nInside Global default params {} section, on line 128 of the nextflow.config under // Load base.config by default for all pipelines:\n\nincludeConfig 'conf/base.config'\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2. When to use a custom config file\nThere are a number of situations in which you may want to write a custom configuration file:\n\nTo override the default resource allocations of the workflow specified in the nextflow.config\nTo override the default resource allocations for a process specified in conf/base.config\nTo use a different software installation method than those supported by nf-core\nTo run a workflow on an HPC and interact with a job scheduler like PBSpro or SLURM\n\nUsing a custom configuration file is good practice to ensure that your pipeline runs efficiently and reproducibly on your compute environment. It also allows you to easily share the pipeline with others who can use your custom config file to run it in the same computational environment.\nWe will write a custom configuration file to override the default configurations of the workflow with those that are suitable for our Nimbus instances. We‚Äôre going to replace 3 flags in our run command with this file:\n\n-profile singularity\n--max_memory 6.GB\n--max_cpus 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should I be concerned with computational efficiency? üåè\n\n\n\nBioinformatics relies on large-scale computational infrastructures and has a signficant carbon footprint due to the energy required to run computational workflows. We can optimise our worklfows to not only reduce their runtime, but also adopt more sustainable computing practices. This paper makes for an interesting read about the carbon footprint of bioinformatics workflows and tools!\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3. Customise resource configuration\nOpen a new file called custom-nimbus.config and start writing some Nextflow code by adding:\n// Nimbus nf-core workshop configuration profile\n\nprofiles {\n  workshop {}\n}\nUsing the profiles scope in a configuration file groups attributes that belong to the same profile, in our case workshop. Inside this workflow profile, let‚Äôs remove the need for the -profile singularity flag from our run command by enabling Singularity by adding another scope called Singularity:\n// Nimbus nf-core workshop configuration profile\n\nprofiles {\n  workshop {\n    singularity {\n      enabled     = true\n      autoMounts  = true\n      cacheDir    = \"/home/ubuntu/singularity_cache\"\n    }}\n  }\nNextflow has a number of options for using Singularity that allow you to control how containers are executed. We are using:\n\nenabled to use Singularity to manage containers automatically\nautoMounts to allow Nextflow to automatically mount host paths when a container is executed\ncacheDir to specify the directory Singularity images can be pulled from\n\nNow let‚Äôs address those two resource parameters --max_memory 6.GB and --max_cpus 2. At the same level as the singularity {} scope, add a parameters scope and specify each parameter underneath:\n// Nimbus nf-core workshop configuration profile\n\nprofiles {\n  workshop {\n    singularity {\n      enabled     = true\n      autoMounts  = true\n      cacheDir    = \"/home/ubuntu/singularity_cache\"\n    }\n    params {\n      max_cpus   = 2\n      max_memory = '6.GB'      \n    }}\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake note!\n\n\n\nIn Nextflow, scope organisation and heirarchy is indicated by curly bracket ({}) notation, not by text indentation!\n\n\nRerun the pipeline:\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/main.nf \\\n  -profile workshop \\\n  -c custom-nimbus.config \\\n  -params-file workshop-params.yaml \\\n  --outdir Lesson-3 \\\n  -resume\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus exercise: applying an institutional config\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey points\n\n\n\n\ntakeaway 1\ntakeaway 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

    "text": "Objectives\n\n\n\n\nWrite a parameter file\nUnderstand the YAML file format\nRerun the workflow using a params file\nUnderstand the use of the params file for reproducible and transparent research\n\n\n\nIn Nextflow, parameters are values that can be set by the user and used to control the behaviour of a workflow or process within the workflow. They are defined by the params scope. Parameters are also used in nf-core workflows to specify input and output files and define other aspects of workflow execution. Each nf-core pipeline comes with a default set of parameters that can be customised to suit specific requirements.\nIn the previous lesson we supplied these parameters as flags in our run command. Nextflow also allows us to pass all parameters to a pipeline‚Äôs run command using the -params-file flag and a JSON or YAML file. In this lesson we‚Äôre going to adjust our run command and rerun the pipeline using a parameter file, rather than specifying all parameters as separate flags in the run command.\n\n2.3.1. Revise the run command\nWhile our pipeline completed successfully, there were a couple of warning messages that may be cause for concern:\n-[nf-core/rnaseq] Pipeline completed successfully with skipped sampl(es)-\n-[nf-core/rnaseq] Please check MultiQC report: 6/6 samples failed strandedness check.-\nCompleted at: 21-Apr-2023 03:58:56\nDuration    : 13m 59s\nCPU hours   : 0.4\nSucceeded   : 200\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandling dodgy error messages ü§¨\n\n\n\nThe first warning message isn‚Äôt very descriptive (see this pull request). You might come across small but inconsequential issues like this when running nf-core pipelines, too. End user feedback is always helpful for software developers, so consider submitting a GitHub issue or starting a discussion in the relevant Slack channel so others are aware and it can be addressed by developers.\n\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look at the MultiQC report, as directed by the second message. You can find this report in the Lesson-1/ directory:\nls -la Lesson-1/multiqc/star_salmon/\ntotal 1468\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 ubuntu ubuntu    4096 Apr 12 04:13 .\ndrwxrwxr-x 3 ubuntu ubuntu    4096 Apr 12 04:13 ..\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu    4096 Apr 12 04:13 multiqc_data\ndrwxrwxr-x 5 ubuntu ubuntu    4096 Apr 12 04:13 multiqc_plots\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1483297 Apr 12 04:13 multiqc_report.html\nOpen the multiqc_report.html the file navigator panel on the left side of your VS Code window by clicking on it. Then open the rendered html file using the Live Server extension:\n\nCtrl+Shift+P to open the command palette\nSelect Live Server: Open with Live Server to open html file in your browser window.\n\nTake a look a the section labelled WARNING: Fail Strand Check\n\nThe issue here is provided strandedness that we specified in our samplesheet.csv and inferred strandedness identified by Salmon do not match. Look‚Äôs like we‚Äôve incorrectly specified strandedness as forward in the samplesheet.csv (my mistake! üòë) when our raw reads actually show an equal distribution of sense and antisense reads. Let‚Äôs check how the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline ran the Salmon quantification process so we can explore whether or not this will potentially have an impact on our results.\n\n\n2.3.2. Identify the run command for a process\nTo understand what command is being run for a process, you can attempt to infer this information from a process main.nf script in the modules/ directory. However, given all the different parameters that may be applied, this may not be straight forward. To understand what Salmon is doing, we‚Äôre going to use the nextflow log command and some custom bash code to track down the hidden .command.sh scripts for each Salmon quant process to find out how Salmon quant identified library type.\nUse the Nextflow log command to reveal information about executed pipelines in our working directory:\nnextflow log\nThis will print a list of executed pipelines, by default:\nTIMESTAMP               DURATION        RUN NAME                STATUS  REVISION ID     SESSION ID                              COMMAND                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n2023-04-21 00:30:30     -               friendly_montalcini     -       f421ddc35d      685266bb-b99b-4945-9a54-981e8f4b1b07    nextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/main.nf --help                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n2023-04-21 00:40:58     15m 36s         nauseous_lamarck        OK      f421ddc35d      055e7b7f-c3ea-4fd9-a915-02343099939e    nextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/main.nf --input samplesheet.csv -profile singularity --fasta /home/ubuntu/session2/materials/mm10_reference/mm10_chr18.fa --gtf /home/ubuntu/session2/materials/mm10_reference/mm10_chr18.gtf --star_index /home/ubuntu/session2/materials/mm10_reference/STAR --max_memory 6.GB --max_cpus 2 --outdir Lesson-1\nAll recent runs will be listed in this file, with the most recent at the top. Let‚Äôs query the logs for the Lesson-1 run. Run the command below after filling in your unique run name. For example:\nnextflow log nauseous_lamarck\nThat command will list out all the work subdirectories for all processes run. Recall that the actual tool commands issued by the nexflow processes are all recorded in hidden script files called .command.sh within the execution process directory. One way of observing the actual run commands issued by the workflow is to view these command scripts.\nBut how to find them? ü§î\nLet‚Äôs add some custom bash code to query a Nextflow run with the run name from the previous lesson. First, save your run name in a bash variable. For example:\nrun_name=nauseous_lamarck\nAnd let‚Äôs save the tool of interest (salmon) in another bash variable:\ntool=salmon\nNext, run the following bash command:\nnextflow log ${run_name} | while read line;\n    do\n      cmd=$(ls ${line}/.command.sh 2&gt;/dev/null);\n      if grep -q $tool $cmd;\n      then  \n        echo $cmd;     \n      fi; \n    done \nThat will list all process .command.sh scripts containing ‚Äòsalmon‚Äô. There are multiple salmon steps in the workflow, inlcuding index and an R script. We are looking for salmon quant which performs the read quantification. For example:\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/50/d4462ece237213ace901a779a45286/.command.sh\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/2f/11774c859f9f55f816b754a65290a7/.command.sh\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/bc/0478d8de4d1c6df1413c50f4bffcb1/.command.sh\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/af/57d1741b614927225fe6381333d615/.command.sh\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/e6/6a644b0d85f03ec91cd2efe5a485d2/.command.sh\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/7d/ff697b987403d2f085b8b538260b67/.command.sh\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/3e/1b7b0f03c7c7c462a4593f77be544e/.command.sh\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/31/5e6865dbbbb164a87d2254b68670fa/.command.sh\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/79/93034bd48f5a0de82e79a1fd12f6ac/.command.sh\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/ca/bbfba0ea604d479bdc4870e9b3b4ce/.command.sh\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/ec/0a013bfb1f96d3c7170137262294e7/.command.sh\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/b7/37428bc5be1fd2c34e3911fb827334/.command.sh\n/home/ubuntu/session2/work/57/a18fcea6a06565b14140ab06a3d077/.command.sh\nCompared with the salmon quant main.nf file, we get more information from the .command.sh process scripts:\ncat rnaseq/modules/nf-core/salmon/quant/main.nf\n\nLooking at the nf-core/rnaseq documentation, we can see:\n. Library type is automatically inferred based on the $strandedness variable . Library type can be adjusted using Salmon‚Äôs --libType= flag and the nf-core $strandedness variable.\nFollowing the recommendations in the Salmon documentation, we‚Äôre going to override this default with the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline‚Äôs --salmon_quant_libtype A parameter.\n\n\n2.3.3. Write a parameter file\nNextflow accepts either YAML or JSON formats for parameter files. YAML and JSON are formats for storing data objects and structures in a file and either is a valid choice for building your parameters file. We will create and apply a YAML file with our inputs for our second run, just because its easier to read. YAML files follow these syntax rules:\n\nFiles use indentation to define nesting and heirarchy\nFiles can use comment lines prefaced by a # character\nFiles consist of key-value pairs\nEach key is followed by a colon (:) and a space\nThe value can be any valid YAML data type (i.e.¬†string, number, boolean, list, or dictionary).\nStrings can be specified using single quotes ('), double quotes (\"), and plain text (boolean).\nYAML is case sensitive\nFiles should have a .yaml or .yml as the file extension\nYAML does not allow the use of tabs, only spaces\nLists begin with a hyphen\nEach key and value must be unique\nThe order of keys or values in a list doesn‚Äôt matter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nUsing the syntax rules above:\n\nAdd the appropriate YAML fields from your previous run command to the params file below. You‚Äôll be sharing this file with a collaborator working on a different computational infrastructure but the same input and reference files.\n\noutdir: \"Lesson-2\"\nsalmon_quant_libtype: \"A\"\nsave_trimmed: true \nsave_unaligned: true \nextra_salmon_quant_args: \"--numBootstraps 10\"\nüí° HINT: you will only need to specify nf-core/rnaseq parameters (i.e.¬†-- flags)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSave this file as workshop-params.yaml:\ninput: \"samplesheet.csv\" \ngtf: \"/home/ubuntu/session2/materials/mm10_reference/mm10_chr18.gtf\"\nfasta: \"/home/ubuntu/session2/materials/mm10_reference/mm10_chr18.fa\"\nstar_index: \"/home/ubuntu/session2/materials/mm10_reference/STAR\" \noutdir: \"Lesson-2\"\nsalmon_quant_libtype: \"A\"\nsave_trimmed: true \nsave_unaligned: true \nextra_salmon_quant_args: \"--numBootstraps 10\"\n\n\n\nAny of the pipeline parameters can be added to the parameters file in this way.\n\n\n2.3.4. Pass the parameter file to the run command\nOnce your params file has been saved, run the following command. Observe:\n\nThe command is shorter thanks to offloading some parameters to the params file\nThe -resume flag. Nextflow has lots of run options including the ability to use cached output!\n\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/main.nf \\\n  --max_memory 6.GB \\\n  --max_cpus 2 \\\n  -profile singularity \\\n  -params-file workshop-params.yaml \\\n  --outdir Lesson-2 \\\n  -resume                        \nAs we‚Äôve used the -resume flag, the initial pre-processing stage and STAR alignments should to be restored from cache and only the Salmon and downstream QC steps will be recomputed. The rerun workflow should complete in a much shorter time and those warnings should have gone away!\n-[nf-core/rnaseq] Pipeline completed successfully -\nCompleted at: 21-Apr-2023 05:58:06\nDuration    : 2m 1s\nCPU hours   : 0.4 (85.9% cached)\nSucceeded   : 15\nCached      : 185\n\n\n2.3.5. Manage parameters with nf-core schema\nnf-core pipelines all have a nextflow_schema.json file in their root directory which explains all the parameters used by the workflow. You can use the nf-core schema tool to validate pipeline parameters, build a pipeline schema, deploy the documentation for a pipeline schema, or add new parameters to a pipeline schema (take a look at this nf-core bytesize talk! for a demonstration). Have a go at these bonus exercises, beware adjusting the nextflow_schema.json file will mean any subsequent workflow run will have to start from scratch again and prevent you applying the -resume function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus exercise: nf-core schema build to customise help command\n\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs use this utility to simplify the workflow run process for our colleague who is new to nf-core pipelines and RNAseq data processing and works in the same compute environment as us. We‚Äôll customise our local copy of the nextflow_schema.json file to show only required paramerters for our experiment in the --help message to make it easier for them to write their own run command:\n\nRun the command below and follow the prompts to launch the schema web builder:\n\nnf-core schema build -d nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/\n\n\nFor the Input/output options group, tick the Required box for the following and the Hide box for everything else:\n\n\n‚úÖ input\n‚úÖ outdir\n\n\nFor the UMI filtering options group, tick the Hide box at the group level.\nFor the Read filtering options group, tick the Hide box at the group level.\nFor the Reference genome options group, tick the Required box for the following and the Hide box for everything else:\n\n\n‚úÖ fasta\n‚úÖ gtf\n‚úÖ star_index\n\n\nFor the Read trimming options group, tick the Required box for the following and the Hide box for everything else:\n\n\n‚úÖ save_trimmed\n\n\nFor the Alignment options group, tick the Required box for the following and the Hide box for everything else:\n\n\n‚úÖ aligner\n‚úÖ save_unaligned\n\n\nFor the Process skipping options group, tick the Hide box at the group level.\nFor the Institutional config options group, tick the Hide box at the group level.\nFor the Max job request options group, tick the Required box for:\n\n\n‚úÖ max_cpus\n‚úÖ max_memory\n\n\nFor the Generic options group, untick the Required and Hide boxes for:\n\n\nüü© help\nüü© version\nüü© multiqc_config\n\nTick the Hide box for everything else.\n\nNow re-build the schema by hitting the blue ‚òëÔ∏è Finished box in the top right of your browser.\nReturn to your terminal and look at your updated help message:\n\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/main.nf --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus exercise: nf-core schema docs to customise documentation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe schema docs utility can be used to output parameter documentation to html or markdown format that you could include in custom documentation. To print\nnf-core schema docs \\\n  nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/nextflow_schema.json --force \\\n  &gt; custom-params.md\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus exercise: nf-core schema validate to check params file\n\n\n\n\n\nThe schema validate utility can be used to validate your specified parameters against the provided pipeline schema. Unfortunately, this won‚Äôt work for your workshop-params.yaml, so we first need to convert this to a JSON file format. To do this, run the following from the session2 directory:\n\nConvert the YAML file to JSON format and save this file as workshop-params.json\n\n{\n    \"input\": \"samplesheet.csv\",\n    \"gtf\": \"/home/ubuntu/session2/materials/mm10_reference/mm10_chr18.gtf\",\n    \"fasta\": \"/home/ubuntu/session2/materials/mm10_reference/mm10_chr18.fa\",\n    \"star_index\": \"/home/ubuntu/session2/materials/mm10_reference/STAR\",\n    \"outdir\": \"Lesson-2\",\n    \"salmon_quant_libtype\": \"A\",\n    \"save_trimmed\": true,\n    \"save_unaligned\": true,\n    \"extra_salmon_quant_args\": \"--numBootstraps 10\"\n  }\n\nRun the nf-core schema command to validate the specified parameters:\n\nnf-core schema validate rnaseq workshop-params.json\nNote this only confirms your inputs match their specified type (i.e.¬†boolean, string, number).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus exercise: nf-core schema build to add new parameter\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO create activity https://nf-co.re/tools/#add-new-parameters-to-the-pipeline-schema\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey points\n\n\n\n\nA parameter file can be used to specify input parameters for any Nextflow workflow.\nSpecify parameter files in a workflow run command using the -params-file flag.\nParameter files can be written in YAML or JSON file formats.\nThe nf-core schema utilities can be used to aid parameter documentation and usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

    "title": "Configuring nf-core workflows",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Objectives\n\n\n\n\nLearn about the structure of an nf-core workflow.\nLearn how to customize the execution of an nf-core workflow.\nCustomize a toy example of an nf-core workflow.\n\n\n\n\n1.3.1. Workflow structure\nnf-core workflows follow a set of best practices and standardized conventions. nf-core workflows start from a common template and follow the same structure. Although you won‚Äôt need to edit code in the workflow project directory, having a basic understanding of the project structure and some core terminology will help you understand how to configure its execution.\n\nNextflow DSL2 workflows are built up of subworkflows and modules that are stored as separate .nf files.\n\nMost nf-core workflows consist of a single workflow file (there are a few exceptions). This is the main &lt;workflow&gt;.nf file that is used to bring everything else together. Instead of having one large monolithic script, it is broken up into a combination of subworkflows and modules.\nA subworkflow is a groups of modules that are used in combination with each other and have a common purpose. For example, the SAMTOOLS_STATS, SAMTOOLS_IDXSTATS, and SAMTOOLS_FLAGSTAT modules are all included in the BAM_STATS_SAMTOOLS subworkflow. Subworkflows improve workflow readability and help with the reuse of modules within a workflow. Within a nf-core workflow, a subworkflow can be an nf-core subworkflow or as a local subworkflow. Like an nf-core workflow, an nf-core subworkflow is developed by the community and are shared in the nf-core subworkflows GitHub repository. Local subworkflows are workflow specific that are not shared in the nf-core subworkflows repository.\nA module is a wrapper for a process, the basic processing primitive to execute a user script. It can specify directives, inputs, outputs, when statements, and a script block. Most modules will execute a single tool in the script block and will make use of the directives, inputs, outputs, and when statements dynamically. Like subworkflows, modules can also be developed and shared in the nf-core modules GitHub repository or stored as a local module. All modules from the nf-core repository are version controlled and tested to ensure reproducibility and best practices. Local modules are workflow specific that are not shared in the nf-core modules repository.\n\n\n1.3.2. Configuration\nEach nf-core workflow has its own configuration and parameter defaults. These default parameters are required for tests to pass as the workflow is being developed and when it is pushed to GitHub. While the workflow configuration defaults are a great place to start, you will almost certainly want to modify these to fit your own purposes and system requirements.\nWhen a workflow is launched, Nextflow will look for configuration files in several locations. As each configuration file can contain conflicting settings, the sources are ranked to decide which settings to apply. Configuration sources are reported below and listed in order of priority:\n\nParameters specified on the command line (--parameter)\nParameters that are provided using the -params-file option\nConfig file that are provided using the -c option\nThe config file named nextflow.config in the current directory\nThe config file named nextflow.config in the workflow project directory\nThe config file $HOME/.nextflow/config\nValues defined within the workflow script itself (e.g., main.nf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Workflow parameters must be passed via the command line (--&lt;parameter&gt;) or Nextflow -params-file option. Custom config files, including those provided by the -c option, can be used to provide any configuration except for parameters.\n\n\nNotably, while some of these files are already included in the nf-core workflow repository (e.g., the nextflow.config file in the nf-core workflow repository), others are automatically identified on your local system (e.g., the nextflow.config in the launch directory), and others are only included if they are specified using run options (e.g., -params-file, and -c). Understanding how and when these files are interpreted by Nextflow is critical for the accurate configuration of it‚Äôs execution.\n\n\n1.3.3. Viewing parameters\nEvery nf-core workflow has a full list of parameters on the nf-core website. When viewing these parameters online, you will also be shown a description and the type of the parameter. Some parameters will also have additional text to help you understand when and how a parameter should be used.\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters and their descriptions can also be viewed in the command line using the run command with the --help parameter:\nnextflow run nf-core/&lt;workflow&gt; --help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nView the parameters for the Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo workflow using the command line:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters for the Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo workflow can be printed using the run command and the --help option:\nnextflow run Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo --help\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4. Parameters in the command line\nAt the highest level, parameters can be customized at execution using the command line. Any parameter can be specified on the command line by prefixing the parameter name with a double dash (--):\nnextflow nf-core/&lt;workflow&gt; --&lt;parameter&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhile Nextflow options are prefixed with a single dash (-) all workflow parameters are prefixed with a double dash (--).\n\n\nDepending on the parameter type you may be required to add additional information. For example, for a string parameter, you would add the string in quotes after the parameter flag:\nnextflow nf-core/&lt;workflow&gt; --&lt;parameter&gt; \"string\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nGive the MultiQC report for the Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo workflow the name of your favorite animal using the multiqc_title parameter in the command line:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd the --multiqc_title flag to your command and execute it. You can also add the -resume option to save time:\nnextflow run Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo --multiqc_title \"koala\" -resume \nIn this example, you can check your parameter has been applied by listing the files created in your results folder (my_results):\nls my_results/multiqc/\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5. Default configuration files\nAll parameters will have a default setting that is defined using the nextflow.config file in the workflow project directory. By default, most parameters are set to null or false and are only activated by a profile or other configuration profile.\nThere are also several includeConfig statements in the nextflow.config file that are used to include additional .config files from the conf/ folder. Each additional .config file contains categorized configuration information for your workflow execution, some of which can be optionally included:\n\nbase.config\n\nIncluded by default.\nGenerous resource allocations using labels.\nDoes not specify any method for software management and expects software to be available (or specified elsewhere).\n\nigenomes.config\n\nIncluded by default.\nDefault configuration to access reference files stored on AWS iGenomes.\n\nmodules.config\n\nIncluded by default.\nModule-specific configuration options (both mandatory and optional).\n\ntest.config\n\nOnly included if specified as a profile.\nA configuration profile to test the workflow with a small test dataset.\n\ntest_full.config\n\nOnly included if specified as a profile.\nA configuration profile to test the workflow with a full-size test dataset.\n\n\nNotably, configuration files can also contain the definition of one or more profiles. A profile is a set of configuration attributes that can be activated when launching a workflow by using the -profile command option:\nnextflow run nf-core/&lt;workflow&gt; -profile &lt;profile&gt;\nProfiles used by nf-core workflows include:\n\nSoftware management profiles\n\nProfiles for the management of software using software management tools, e.g., docker, singularity, and conda.\n\nTest profiles\n\nProfiles to execute the workflow with a standardized set of test data and parameters, e.g., test and test_full.\n\n\nMultiple profiles can be specified in a comma-separated (,) list when you execute your command. The order of profiles is important as they will be read from left to right:\nnextflow run nf-core/&lt;workflow&gt; -profile test,singularity\nnf-core workflows are required to define software containers and conda environments that can be activated using profiles. Although it is possible to run the workflows with software installed by other methods (e.g., environment modules or manual installation), most users find that Docker and Singularity are most convenient and reproducible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre computer has internet access and one of Conda, Singularity, or Docker installed, you should be able to run any nf-core workflow with the test profile and the respective software management profile ‚Äòout of the box‚Äô. The test data profile will pull test data directly from the nf-core/test-data GitHub repository and run it on your local system without you needing to set up your own test data. The test profile is an important control to check the workflow is working as expected. Some workflows have multiple test profiles for you to test.\n\n\n\n\n1.3.6. Shared configuration files\nAn includeConfig statement in the nextflow.config file is also used to include custom institutional profiles that have been submitted to the nf-core config repository. At run time, nf-core workflows will fetch these configuration profiles from the remote configs repository and make them available.\nFor shared resources such as an HPC cluster, you may consider developing a shared institutional profile. You can follow this tutorial for more help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPawsey already has a shared profile that can be used to run workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nParameters can be included in an institutional config.\n\n\n\n\n1.3.7. Custom configuration files\nNextflow will also look for custom configuration files that are external to the workflow project directory. These files include:\n\nThe config file $HOME/.nextflow/config\nA config file named nextflow.config in the current directory\nCustom files specified using the command line\n\nA parameter file that is provided using the -params-file option\nA config file that are provided using the -c option\n\n\nYou can be clever with the what settings you configure in each of these files.\nParameter files\nParameter files are .json files that can contain an unlimited number of parameters:\n{\n   \"&lt;parameter1_name&gt;\": 1,\n   \"&lt;parameter2_name&gt;\": \"&lt;string&gt;\",\n   \"&lt;parameter3_name&gt;\": true\n}\nYou can override default parameters by creating a custom .json file and passing it as a command-line argument using the -param-file option.\nnextflow run nf-core/&lt;workflow&gt; -profile test,docker -param-file &lt;path/to/params.json&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nGive the MultiQC report for the Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo workflow the name of your favorite food using the multiqc_title parameter in a parameters file:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a custom .json file that contains:\n{\n   \"multiqc_title\": \"cheese\"\n}\nInclude the custom .json file in your execution command with the -params-file option.\nnextflow run Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo -resume -params-file my_custom_params.json\nCheck that it has been applied\nls my_results/multiqc/\n\n\n\nConfiguration files\nConfiguration files are .config files that can contain various workflow properties. Custom paths passed in the command-line using the -c option:\nnextflow run nf-core/&lt;workflow&gt; -profile test,docker -c &lt;path/to/custom.config&gt;\nMultiple custom .config files can be included at execution by separating them with a comma (,).\nCustom configuration files follow the same structure as the configuration file included in the workflow directory. Configuration properties are organized into scopes by dot prefixing the property names with a scope identifier or grouping the properties in the same scope using the curly brackets notation. For example:\nalpha.x  = 1\nalpha.y  = 'string value..'\nIs equivalent to:\nalpha {\n     x = 1\n     y = 'string value..'\n}\nScopes allow you to quickly configure settings required to deploy a workflow on different infrastructure using different software management. For example, the executor scope can be used to provide settings for the deployment of a workflow on a HPC cluster. Similarly, the singularity scope controls how Singularity containers are executed by Nextflow. Multiple scopes can be included in the same .config file using a mix of dot prefixes and curly brackets. A full list of scopes is described in detail here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nGive the MultiQC report for the Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo workflow the name of your favorite color using the multiqc_title parameter in a custom .config file:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a custom .config file that contains:\nparams.multiqc_title = \"blue\"\nInclude the custom .config file in your execution command with the -c option:\nnextflow run Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo -resume -c my_custom_config.config\nCheck to see if it has been applied:\nls my_results/multiqc/\n\nRemember: You can not use the params scope in custom configuration files. Your favorite color will not be shown in the name of the multiqc report.\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, the process scope allows you to configure workflow processes and is used extensively to define resources and additional arguments for modules.\nBy default, process resources are allocated in the conf/base.config file using the withLabel selector:\nprocess {\n    withLabel: BIG_MEM {\n        cpus = 16\n        memory = 64.GB\n    }\n}\nSimilarly, the withName selector enables the configuration of a process by name. By default, module parameters are defined in the conf/modules.config file:\nprocess {\n    withName: MYPROCESS {\n        cpus = 4\n        memory = 8.GB\n    }\n}\nWhile some tool arguments are included as a part of a module. To make modules sharable across workflows, most tool arguments are defined in the conf/modules.conf file in the workflow code under the ext.args entry.\nFor example, if you were trying to overwrite arguments in the TRIMGALORE process in the nf-core/rnaseq workflow, you could use the process scope:\nprocess {\n    withName : \".*:TRIMGALORE\" {\n        ext.args   = { \"&lt;your custom parameter&gt;\" }\n\n    }\nHowever, as the TRIMGALORE process is used multiple times in this workflow, an extended execution path of the module is required to make it more specific:\nprocess {\n    withName: \"NFCORE_RNASEQ:RNASEQ:FASTQ_FASTQC_UMITOOLS_TRIMGALORE:TRIMGALORE\" {\n        ext.args = \"&lt;your custom parameter&gt;\"\n    }\n}\nThe extended execution path is built from the workflows, subworkflows, and modules used to execute the process.\nIn the example above, the nf-core TRIMGALORE module, was called by the FASTQ_FASTQC_UMITOOLS_TRIMGALORE subworkflow, which was called by the RNASEQ workflow, which was called by the NFCORE_RNASEQ workflow in the main.nf file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt can be tricky to evaluate the path used to execute a module. If you are unsure of how to build the path you can copy it from the conf/modules.conf file.\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\nCreate a new .config file that uses the process and scope to overwrite the args for the MULTIQC process. Change the args to \"--title \\\"customargs\\\"\"\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nnextflow run Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo -resume -c my_custom_config.config -params-file my_custom_params.json --multiqc_title \"koala\"\nAs the command line is at the top of the hierarchy, the multiqc_title will be ‚Äúkoala‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nDemonstrate the configuration hierarchy using the Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo workflow by modifying the multiqc_title the with a custom config file (-c), a params file (-params-file), and a command line flag (--multiqc_title). You can use the files you have already created:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nnextflow run Sydney-Informatics-Hub/nf-core-demo -resume -c my_custom_config.config -params-file my_custom_params.json --multiqc_title \"koala\"\nAs the command line is at the top of the hierarchy, the multiqc_title will be ‚Äúkoala‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey points\n\n\n\n\nPoint 1\nPoint 2\nPoint 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

    "text": "Objectives\n\n\n\n\nLearn about the core features of nf-core.\nLearn how to use nf-core tooling.\nUse Nextflow to pull the nf-core/rnaseq workflow\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1. What is nf-core?\n\nnf-core is a community effort to collect a curated set of analysis workflows built using Nextflow.\nnf-core provides a standardized set of best practices, guidelines, and templates for building and sharing bioinformatics workflows. These workflows are designed to be modular, scalable, and portable, allowing researchers to easily adapt and run them using their own data and compute resources.\nThe community is a diverse group of bioinformaticians, developers, and researchers from around the world who collaborate on developing and maintaining a growing collection of high-quality workflows. These workflows cover a range of applications, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metagenomics.\nOne of the key benefits of nf-core is that it promotes open development, testing, and peer review, ensuring that the workflows are robust, well-documented, and validated against real-world datasets. This helps to increase the reliability and reproducibility of bioinformatics analyses and ultimately enables researchers to accelerate their scientific discoveries.\nnf-core is published in Nature Biotechnology: Nat Biotechnol 38, 276‚Äì278 (2020). Nature Biotechnology\nKey Features of nf-core workflows\n\nDocumentation\n\nnf-core workflows have extensive documentation covering installation, usage, and description of output files to ensure that you won‚Äôt be left in the dark.\n\nCI Testing\n\nEvery time a change is made to the workflow code, nf-core workflows use continuous-integration testing to ensure that nothing has broken.\n\nStable Releases\n\nnf-core workflows use GitHub releases to tag stable versions of the code and software, making workflow runs totally reproducible.\n\nPackaged software\n\nPipeline dependencies are automatically downloaded and handled using Docker, Singularity, Conda, or other software management tools. There is no need for any software installations.\n\nPortable and reproducible\n\nnf-core workflows follow best practices to ensure maximum portability and reproducibility. The large community makes the workflows exceptionally well-tested and easy to run.\n\nCloud-ready\n\nnf-core workflows are tested on AWS after every major release. You can even browse results live on the website and use outputs for your own benchmarking.\n\n\nIt is important to remember all nf-core workflows are open-source and community driven. Most pipelines are under active community development and are regularly updated with fixes and other improvements. Even though the pipelines and tools undergo repeated community review and testing - it is important to check your results*.\n\n\n1.2.2. Events\nnf-core events are community-driven gatherings that provide a platform to discuss the latest developments in Nextflow and nf-core workflows. These events include community seminars, trainings, and hackathons, and are open to anyone who is interested in using and developing nf-core and its applications. Most events are held virtually, making them accessible to a global audience.\nUpcoming events are listed on the nf-core event page and announced on Slack and Twitter.\n\n\n1.2.3. Join the community!\nThere are several ways you can join the nf-core community. You are welcome to join any or all of these at any time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoining the nf-core Slack can be especially useful for users. There are dedicated channels for all workflows as well as channels for common topics. If you are unsure of where to ask you questions - the #help and #nostupidquestions channels are a great place to start.\nIf you are joining the nf-core Slack for the first time make sure you drop a message in #say-hello to introduce yourself!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions about Nextflow\n\n\n\nIf you have questions about Nextflow and deployments that are not related to nf-core you can ask them on the Nextflow Slack. It‚Äôs worthwhile joining both Slack groups and browsing the channels to get an idea of what types of questions are being asked on each channel. Searching channels can also be a great source of information as your question may have been asked before.\n\n\nThe nf-core YouTube channel is also especially helpful. There are lots of great workshops and ByteSize seminars for developers and users.\n\n\n1.2.4. nf-core tools\nThis workshop will make use of nf-core tools, a set of helper tools for use with Nextflow workflows. These tools have been developed to provide a range of additional functionality for using, developing, and testing workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to download nf-core tools\n\n\n\nnf-core tools is written in Python and is available from the Python Package Index (PyPI):\npip install nf-core\nAlternatively, nf-core tools can be installed from Bioconda:\nconda install -c bioconda nf-core\n\n\nThe nf-core --version option can be used to print your version of nf-core tools:\nnf-core --version\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nFind out what version of nf-core tools you have available using the nf-core --version option:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the nf-core --version option to print your nf-core tools version:\nnf-core --version\n\n\n\n\nnf-core tools are for everyone and has commands to help both users and developers. For users, the tools make it easier to run workflows. For developers, the tools make it easier to develop and test your workflows using best practices. You can read about the nf-core commands on the tools page of the nf-core website or using the command line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nFind out what nf-core tools commands and options are available using the --help option:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the --help option to list the options, tools for users, and tools for developers\nnf-core --help\n\n\n\n\nnf-core tools is updated with new features and fixes regularly so it‚Äôs best to keep your version of nf-core tools up-to-date.\n\n\n1.2.5. Running an nf-core workflow\nThere are currently 80 workflows (March 2023) available as part of nf-core. These workflows are at various stages of development with 49 released, 19 under development, and 12 archived.\nThe nf-core website has a full list of workflows, as well as their documentation, which can be explored.\nEach workflow has a dedicated page that includes expansive documentation that is split into 7 sections:\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn introduction and overview of the workflow\n\nResults\n\nExample output files generated from the full test dataset\n\nUsage docs\n\nDescriptions of how to run the workflow\n\nParameters\n\nGrouped workflow parameters with descriptions\n\nOutput docs\n\nDescriptions and examples of the expected output files\n\nReleases & Statistics\n\nWorkflow version history and statistics\n\n\nUnless you are actively developing workflow code, you don‚Äôt need to clone the workflow code from GitHub and can use Nextflow‚Äôs built-in functionality to pull and a workflow. As shown in the introduction to Nextflow, the Nextflow pull command can download and cache workflows from GitHub repositories:\nnextflow pull nf-core/&lt;pipeline&gt;\nNextflow run will also automatically pull the workflow if it was not already available locally:\nnextflow run nf-core/&lt;pipeline&gt;\nNextflow will pull the default git branch if a workflow version is not specified. This will be the master branch for nf-core workflows with a stable release. nf-core workflows use GitHub releases to tag stable versions of the code and software. You will always be able to run a previous version of a workflow once it is released using the -revision or -r flag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nUse Nextflow to pull the latest version of the nf-core/rnaseq workflow directly from GitHub:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the Nextlfow pull command to download the rnaseq workflow from the nf-core GitHub repository.\nnextflow pull nf-core/rnaseq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey points\n\n\n\n\nnf-core is a community effort to collect a curated set of analysis workflows built using Nextflow.\nYou can join/follow nf-core on multiple different social channels (Slack, YouTube, Twitter‚Ä¶)\nnf-core has its own tooling that can be used by users and developers.\nNextflow can be used to pull nf-core workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"

    "title": "2.5. Passing external arguments to a process",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Objectives\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand how to use the ext.args feature to pass additional command-line arguments to a process\nImplement additional external arguments to a process that are not hardcoded in the process script\nObserve the behaviour of Nextflow‚Äôs cache functionality\n\n\n\n\nAll nf-core modules are currently required to provide the mandatory arguments for a tool to run in the process‚Äô main.nf file. Remember that nf-core pipelines generally run with sensible parameters as default, so these processes may also contain commonly changed or applied optional arguments for a tool. Despite this, nf-core pipelines allow you the flexibility to customise the command a process runs, whether it is permitted by the nf-core workflow parameters or not. In this lesson, we will be using Nextflow‚Äôs ext directive to specify an optional argument to a process within the workflow.\n\n2.5.1. External directives in action\nnf-core modules provide all optional non-file arguments as a string using the ext directive via the $task.ext.args variable. In the diagram below, on the left is an example of the standard main.nf format of a process stored in the modules/ directory. Above the script block, the $args variable is defined. Inside the script block the $args variable is applied to the process command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs that Nextflow expression doing?\n\n\n\nThe task.ext.args ?: '' expression checks if the ext.args parameter has already been defined already for a task. If it isn‚Äôt defined it will assign an empty string by default.\n\n\nBut where is the $ext.args string actually defined? In the middle of the diagram below there is an example of a custom configuration file targeting the modules/example/main.nf process. This configuration file is using the EXAMPLE process ext.args to pass -flag1 to the tool command. Running the pipeline having included -c example-custom.config in the run command, you will observe the application of -flag1 in the .command.sh inside that task‚Äôs work directory.\n\n\n\n2.5.2. Customisation at the process level\nTo practice this, we are going to pass an optional flag to the Trim Galore process. It is up to you to decipher what customisations are required to make your analysis suitable for your data and research questions. In order to understand what customisations you may want to specify as extra arguments, we recommend you:\n\nRead the tool documentation to understand all the available parameters for that tool\nView the list of nf-core parameters for that tool\nView which paramteres are hard-coded within the nextflow process\n\nFor the sake of the lesson, let‚Äôs assume we want to increase the minimum quality Phred score from the default of 20 to a much more stringent value of 40.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning!\n\n\n\nFor RNAseq datasets, this Phred score is way too high!\n\n\n\nExplore the full list of Trim Galore parameters either using the Trim Galore documentation.\nLook at the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline parameter options in the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline documentation\nView the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline Trim Galore main.nf file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\n\nWhat Trim Galore flag would you use to change the default Phred score?\nIs this flag offered as an input parameter by the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline?\nWhat optional flags are applied to the Trim Galore process?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--quality or -q\nNo\n--cores and --gzip\n\n\n\n\nWe will follow the Trim Galore user guide to apply the --quality flag with a Phred score of 40:\n--quality 40\n\n\n2.5.3. Observe the application of ext.args\nTo parse that to the Trim Galore process, we need to specify this in a custom config. This time, our Trim Galore custom configuration file will restrict the usage of the parameter to the only place it applies, the Trim Galore process. We can do this using the Nextflow process {} scope and withName: selector.\nOpen a new file trim-galore.config and add the following content:\n// Trim Galore Phred score custom configuration \n\nprocess {\n    withName: '.*:FASTQ_FASTQC_UMITOOLS_TRIMGALORE:TRIMGALORE' {   \n        ext.args = '--quality 40'\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did you find that process name?! ü§Ø\n\n\n\nTracking down process names in nf-core workflow code can be confusing as developers increasingly include subworkflow modules comprising multiple individual modules from the nf-core/modules repository. A process‚Äô name will depend on whether it is included in the workflow as part of a submodule or a module. If we search the workflow code for ‚Äòtrimgalore‚Äô we find trimgalore is included in the FASTQ_FASTQC_UMITOOLS_TRIMGALORE subworkflow:\ngrep \"trimgalore\" nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/workflows/rnaseq.nf\nInside that subworkflow, we can see Trim Galore process is named TRIMGALORE:\ncat nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/subworkflows/nf-core/fastq_fastqc_umitools_trimgalore/main.nf\nHence, our arrival at the name:\nFASTQ_FASTQC_UMITOOLS_TRIMGALORE:TRIMGALORE\n\n\nWe need to instruct nextflow to use the custom config, and we do this with the -c flag:\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/main.nf \\\n  -profile workshop \\\n  -c custom-nimbus.config,trim-galore.config \\\n  -params-file workshop-params.yaml \\\n  --outdir Lesson-5 \\\n  -resume\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nGiven we have applied the -resume flag, what tasks do you expect to be re-run, and what outputs do you expect to be taken from cache?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaken from cache: initial FastQC processes for each fastq file\nRerun: read trimming and all downstream processes\n\n\n\n\nThis time, the workflow should run for a while and then stop before performing read alignment with STAR with the following message üò¶:\n-[nf-core/rnaseq] Pipeline completed successfully with skipped sampl(es)-\n-[nf-core/rnaseq] Please check MultiQC report: 6/6 samples skipped since they failed 10000 trimmed read threshold.-\nOpen the Lesson 5 multiqc_report.html, like you did in the previous lesson. Note the ‚ÄòWARNING: Fail Trimming Check‚Äô on the navigation headings on the left. Click on this warning. Our Phred threshold was way too high, all 6 samples have &lt; 5,000 reads remaining after trimming!\nWhat has caused these samples to fail though? Let‚Äôs take a look at the ‚Äìmin_trimmed_reads parameter documentation. Our samples have less reads after trimming than the default value of 10,000.\nOn your multiqc_report.html file, view the section ‚Äònf-core/rnaseq Workflow Summary‚Äô. The quality parameter is not described.

Depending on how you work, where you work, and what pipelines you run, you may have configuration files that handle distinct issues, can be applied to specific infrastructures, or shared by multiple nf-core pipelines. In this lesson we will be applying multiple configuration files to the one run command.\n\n2.4.1. Apply multiple configurations\nYou may need to apply multiple configuration files at once to an nf-core pipeline run. A few scenarios in which you would need to do this include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario\nWhy?\n\n\n\n\nDebugging and testing\nIf you are toubleshooting a particular process in the workflow, you may want to create a separate config file with process-specific modifications.\n\n\nResource optimisation\nDepending on the scale and complexity of your data, some steps of the pipeline may require different settings or resources to achieve optimal performance. By using different config files with different parameters or settings, you can fine-tune the pipeline run.\n\n\nMultiQC configuration\nMultiQC allows users to specify configuration options in a YAML file called multiqc_config.yaml. This file allows users to customize the behavior and appearance of the MultiQC report.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2. Customised resource tracing\nRemember we can use the Nextflow log command to show information about previous pipeline executions. We can customise which fields to print using the -fields flag. This flag accepts options used by the trace report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nUsing the trace report fields, write a nextflow log command to query the following for a previous workflow run:\n\nThe name of the task\nThe exit status of the task\nThe number of CPUs requested for task execution\nThe disk space requested for the task execution\nThe memory requested for the task execution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nnextflow log &lt;runName&gt; -f name,exit,cpus,disk,memory\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs make a portable configuration file for resource tracing called trace-benchmark.config. We can apply this config when we want to collect resource benchmarks. Because this config is not infrastructure- or pipeline-specific, we can share it with collaborators and use it across multiple pipelines:\n// Define timestamp, to avoid overwriting existing trace \ndef trace_timestamp = new java.util.Date().format('yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss')\n\n// Generate custom resource trace file \ntrace {\n  enabled = true \n  file = \"workshop-resource-trace-${trace_timestamp}.txt\"\n  fields = 'name,status,realtime,cpus,%cpu,memory,%mem,rss'\n}\nRerun the workflow, adding trace-benchmark.config to the config flag and observe the extra file that is saved to our session2 directory:\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/main.nf \\\n  -profile workshop \\\n  -c custom-nimbus.config,trace-benchmark.config \\\n  -params-file workshop-params.yaml \\\n  --outdir Lesson-4 \\\n  -resume\nTake a look at the launch log printed to the screen. You can see your profile, custom config, and parameters have all been applied successfully! Once the workflow has run, take a look at the workshop-resource-trace-${trace_timestamp}.txt file:\nname    status  realtime        cpus    %cpu    memory  %mem    rss\nNFCORE_RNASEQ:RNASEQ:INPUT_CHECK:SAMPLESHEET_CHECK (samplesheet.csv)    CACHED  1s      1       28.0%   6 GB    0.2%    16.1 MB\nNFCORE_RNASEQ:RNASEQ:PREPARE_GENOME:GTF2BED (mm10_chr18.gtf)    CACHED  1s      2       51.3%   6 GB    0.3%    23.8 MB\nNFCORE_RNASEQ:RNASEQ:PREPARE_GENOME:CUSTOM_GETCHROMSIZES (mm10_chr18.fa)        CACHED  1s      1       34.1%   6 GB    0.0%    4.7 MB\nNFCORE_RNASEQ:RNASEQ:PREPARE_GENOME:GTF_GENE_FILTER (mm10_chr18.fa)     CACHED  1s      1       34.7%   6 GB    0.1%    13.9 MB\nNFCORE_RNASEQ:RNASEQ:FASTQ_SUBSAMPLE_FQ_SALMON:FQ_SUBSAMPLE (SRR3473984)        CACHED  2s      1       43.7%   6 GB    0.0%    6.5 MB\nNFCORE_RNASEQ:RNASEQ:PREPARE_GENOME:MAKE_TRANSCRIPTS_FASTA (rsem/mm10_chr18.fa) CACHED  4s      2       42.0%   6 GB    1.2%    94.4 MB\nNFCORE_RNASEQ:RNASEQ:FASTQ_SUBSAMPLE_FQ_SALMON:FQ_SUBSAMPLE (SRR3473985)        CACHED  2s      1       44.1%   6 GB    0.0%    6.3 MB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ò†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt confuse double and single quotes! ‚ò†Ô∏è\n\n\n\nDouble quotes (\"\") allow for variable interpolation, which means that variables can be evaluated and their values are substituted within the string.\nSingle quotes ('') denote a string literally, which means that the string is treated as-is without any variable interpolation.\nTry swapping the double quoted file value in your custom config above for a single-quoted value, rerun the workflow and note the creation of a\nfile = 'workshop-resource-trace-${trace_timestamp}.txt'\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2. Configure MultiQC reports\nMany nf-core pipelines use MultiQC to generate a summary report at the end of a workflow. MultiQC is a reporting tool that can aggregate results and statistics output by various bioinformatics tools. It helps to summarise experiments containing multiple samples and multiple analysis steps. In nf-core pipelines, MultiQC is used to summarise statistics and results output by processes in the workflow and its reports can be quite verbose. MultiQC can be configured using custom YAML files to customise the outputs of reports.\nWe are going to configure MultiQC to aid interpretation of the FastQC output it plots. Create a custom MultiQC configuration YAML file called multiqc-config.yaml and add the following:\nfastqc_config:\n  fastqc_theoretical_gc: \"mm10_txome\" \nHere, we‚Äôre plotting the theoretical GC content for the mouse reference transcript.\nTo the workshop-params.yaml file, add:\nmultiqc_config: \"multiqc-config.yaml\" \nMake sure both YAML files are saved, then re-run the workflow:\nnextflow run nf-core-rnaseq-3.11.1/workflow/main.nf \\\n  -profile workshop \\\n  -c custom-nimbus.config \\\n  -params-file workshop-params.yaml \\\n  --outdir Lesson-4 \\\n  -resume\nThe logging information printed to the screen shows us again that the params.yaml file with the output directory set to Lesson-2 has been overridden by the use of the flag --outdir Lesson-4 in the run command. As the workflow runs, notice all the completed processes that are pulled from the cache and not rerun. Our use of the multiqc-config.yaml file adjusted the MultiQC process, as such this process was repeated using the updated settings.\nThe changes we made above added the normal mouse transcriptome GC profile as a track to the fastQC per-sequence GC content plot. Take a look at the changes, open the Exercise4 multiqc_report.html file with Live Server as per previosuly (or use scp to take a copy to your local computer if you are not on VS Code). Compare this report with the MultiQC report from lesson 1 by looking at the section FastQC: Per Sequence GC Content. Compare the two plots to observe the custom track has been successfully added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nGiven the normal mouse transcriptome GC profile indicated by the black dotted line, can you detect any GC bias in the input sequence data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, all samples‚Äô GC profiles follow a normal distribution.\n\n\n\nNote that if we did detect GC bias, we could go back and correct for this by adding the custom salmon flag --gcBias to the nf-core parameter --extra_salmon_quant_args. If we were to do this, we would have to add the following line to our workflow-params.yaml file:\nextra_salmon_quant_args : '--writeUnmappedNames --gcBias'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey points\n\n\n\n\ntakeaway 1\ntakeaway 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll materials copyright Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney"
