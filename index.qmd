This workshop will provide you with the foundational knowledge required to run and customise nf-core workflows in a reproducible manner. The content is broken up into 2 half-day sessions. In the first session we will cover the basic principles of Nextflow and nf-core pipelines. In the second session we will step through various customisation scenarios using the [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.11.1) pipeline. We will explore ways to adjust the workflow parameters based on the needs of your dataset and configuration the workflow to run on your computational environment. See the [lesson plan](notebooks/0.0_welcome.qmd) for details.
