**This course is currently under development**

This workshop will set you up with the foundational knowledge required to run and customise nf-core workflows in a reproducible manner. Using the nf-core/rnaseq workflow as an example, we will step through essential features common across all nf-core workflows. We will explore ways to adjust the workflow parameters based on the needs of your dataset and configuration the workflow to run on your computational environment.
