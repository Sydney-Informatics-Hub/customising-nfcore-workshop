#### **The most recent Nextlfow log file is always called `nextflow.log`**

Nextflow uses a log rotation system to manage the log files generated during workflow execution. By default, Nextflow keeps a **maximum of 10 log files**, and rotates the file names based on the number of times a workflow has been executed. When you first run a workflow, the log file is named `nextflow.log`. On subsequent runs, the current `nextflow.log` is renamed to `nextflow.log.1`, and the previous `nextflow.log.1` is renamed to `nextflow.log.2`, and so on.
